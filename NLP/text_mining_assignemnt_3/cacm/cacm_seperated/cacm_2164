symbolic integration: the stormy decade.wthree approaches to symbolic integration in the's are described.  the first, from artificial intelligence, led to slagle's saint and to a largedegree to moses' sin.  the second, from algebraic manipulation, led to manove's implementation and tohorowitz' and tobey's reexamination of the hermite algorithm for integrating rational functions.  the third,from mathematics, led to richardson's proof of the unsolvability of the problem for a class of functionsand for risch's decision procedure for the elementary functions.generalizations of risch's algorithmto a class of special functions and programs for solving differential equations and for findingthe definite integral are also described.cacm august, moses, j..kintegration, symbolic integration, definite integrals, rational functions.c. . . . . .ca jb february ,   : pm
