a language for treating graphs.wa language for the representation of graph is described, and the formulation of graph operations such as node and/or link deletion or insertion, union, intersection, comparison, and traversal of graphs is given.  graphsare represented by linked lists.  the language is syntactically definedas an extension to algol , and it is translated into algolby means of a syntax-driven compiler.  application areas for this language areoperation research, network problems, control theory, traffic problems, etc.cacm may, crespi-reghizzi, s.morpurgo, r..kgraphs, oriented, nonoriented, multiple,colored graph, language extended algol,operator-precedence, syntax-driven compiler,operation research, network, traffic.c. . . .ca jb february ,   : pm
