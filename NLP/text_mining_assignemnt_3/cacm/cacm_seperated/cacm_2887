a study of errors, error-proneness, and error diagnosis in cobol.wthis paper provides data on cobol error frequencyfor correction of errors in student-oriented compilers, improvement of teaching, and changes in programminglanguage.  cobol was studied because of economic importance, widespread usage, possible error-includingdesign, and lack of research.  the types of errors were identified in a pilot study; then, usingthe  error types found, , errors were classified in , runs of  cobol students.  errordensity was high:  percent of the types contained  percent of the total frequency, which implies highpotential effectiveness for software based correction of cobol.  surprisingly, only four high-frequency errorswere error-prone, which implies minimal error inducing design.  percent of cobol misspellings were classifiablein the four error categories of previous researchers, which implies that cobol misspellingsare correctable by existent algorithms.  reserved word usage was not error-prone, which implies minimalinterference with usage of reserved words.  over  percent of error diagnosis was found to be inaccurate. such feedback is not optimal for users, particularly for the learning user of cobol.cacm january, litecky, c. r.davis, g. b..kerrors in programming, error correction, cobol, programminglanguage errors, error analysis, diagnostics, error-proneness, error frequency, spelling errors, syntacticerrors, learning of programming, teaching of programming.c. . .ca jb january ,   : am
