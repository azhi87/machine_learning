experiments in text file compression.wa system for the compression of data files,viewed as strings of characters, is presented.  the method is general, and applies equally well toenglish, to pl/i, or to digital data.  the system consists of an encoder, an analysis program, and a decoder.  two algorithms for encoding a string differ slightly from earlier proposals.  the analysis program attemptsto find an optimal set of codes for representing substrings of the file.  four new algorithms for thisoperation are described and compared.  various parameters in the algorithms are optimized to obtaina high degree of compression for sample texts.cacm november, rubin, f..ktext compression, data file compaction, huffmancodes, n-gram encoding, comparison of algorithms.c. . .ca jb january ,   : pm
