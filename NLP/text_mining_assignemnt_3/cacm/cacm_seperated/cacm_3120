an event-driven compiling technique.wdue to the linear structure of source text, difficulties may arise in a one-pass compilation process.  these difficulties occur when an entitycannot be processed because of a forward reference to informationonly obtainable from subsequent entities.  classic solutionsask for data structures appropriate for each case.  a technique ispresented here which uses instead control structures, namely eventsand processes.  the work of the compiler-writer becomes easier bothconceptually and in practice because he can forget these problemsat the outset and he avoids special processing for each problem.this technique has been applied to the construction of an algol compiler.  three examples from that implementationare described and discussed here.cacm january, banatre, j.p.routeau, j.p.trilling, l..kcompiling technique, one-pass compilation, semanticanalysis, event, process, parallelismcategories--.ca dh april ,   : pm
