syntactic analysis by digital computer.wthis paper provides an account of the shadowlanguage that is used to describe syntax and of a corresponding subroutine that enables a computerto perform syntactic analysis.  the input to this subroutine consists of a string to be analyzed and adescription of the syntax that is to be used.  the syntax is expressed in the shadow language.  the outputconsists of a trace table that expresses the results of the syntactic analysis in a tabular form.  severalversions of the subroutine and some associated programs have been in use now for over three years.  thepresent account of the language and the subroutine contains a summary of material that has been describedpreviously in unpublished reports and also some additional discussion of the work in relation to the moregeneral questions of problem-oriented languages and string transformations.cacm october, barnett, m. p.futrelle, r. p.ca jb march ,   : pm
