ethernet: distributed packet switching for local computer networks.wethernet is a branching broadcast communicationsystem for carrying digital data packets among locally distributed computing stations. the packettransport mechanism provided by ethernet has been used to build systems which can be viewed as either localcomputer networks or loosely coupled multiprocessors.  an ethernet's shared communication facility, its ether,is a passive broadcast medium with no central control.  coordination of access to the ether for packetbroadcasts is distributed among the contending transmitting stations using controlled statistical arbitration. switching of packets to their destinations on the ether is distributed among the receiving stationsusing packet address recognition.  design principles and implementation are described, based on experiencewith an operating ethernet of  nodes along a kilometer of coaxial cable.  a model for estimating performanceunder heavy loads and a packet protocol for error controlled communication are included for completeness.cacm july, metcalfe, r. m.boggs, d. r..kcomputer networks, packet switching, multiprocessing,distributed control, distributed computing, broadcast communication, statistical arbitration.c. . .ca jb january ,   : pm
