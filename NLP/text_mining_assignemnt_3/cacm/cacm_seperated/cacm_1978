the use of interactive graphics to solve numerical problems.wwith the advent of on-line (time-sharing) computer systemsand graphic terminals, we have available a new dimensionin numerical problem solving capabilities.  rather than simply usethe new power to achieve fast turnaround, we can develop interactiveroutines which are easy to use and also take advantage of theinsight and visual capabilities of the human problem solver.  severalon-line systems for general purpose mathematical problem solvinghave already been implemented as well as some special purposesystems for solving problems in a particular area such as ordinarydifferential equations.  the advantage of restricting the problemarea is that the interface with a user can be greatly simplified.in this paper we discuss some of the advantages accrued by suchsystems and design considerations for interactive routines.  furthermore,an implementation of an on-line least squares data-fittingprogram, peg, is presented with results obtained from empiricaldata.  in conclusion, area for future work in this field are discussed.cacm october, smith, l. b..kinteractive graphics, computer graphics, graphics, least squares,data-fitting, interactive computing, on-line mathematics.c. . . .ca jb february ,   : am
