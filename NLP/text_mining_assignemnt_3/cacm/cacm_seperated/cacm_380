comparison of iterative methods for the calculation of nth roots.wthree iterative methods for calculation ofnth roots (including one proposed by the author) are compared in two ways: () theoretical convergenceestimates are given.  () a new macrocompiler which estimates machine running time is used to compare therunning time of the three methods for a variety of input data.cacm march, traub, j. f.ca jb march ,   : am
