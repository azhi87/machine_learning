the instrumentation of multics.wan array of measuring tools devised to aid in the implementation of a prototypecomputer utility is discussed.  these tools include special hardwareclocks and data channels, general purpose programmed probingand recording tools, and specialized measurement facilities.  someparticular measurements of interest in a system which combines demand paging with multiprogramming are described in detail.  where appropriate, insight into effectiveness (or lack there of) of individual tools is provided.cacm august, gintell, j. w.saltzer, j. h..kinstrumentation, performance measurement,multiprogramming systems, measuring tools, system analysis, multics,metering, event tracing, demand paging, script drivenmeasurement.c. . . .ca jb february ,   : pm
