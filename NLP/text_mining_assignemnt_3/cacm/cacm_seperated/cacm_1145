git-a heuristic program for testing pairsof directed line graphs for isomorphism*.wgiven a pair of directed line graphs, the problemof ascertaining whether or not they are isomorphic is one for which no efficient algorithmic solution is known. since a straightforward enumerative algorithm might require  years of running time on a very highspeed computer in order to compare two -node graphs, a more sophisticated approach seems calledfor.  the situation is similar to that prevailing in areas such as game-playing and theorem-proving, wherepractical algorithms are unknown (for the interesting cases), but where various practical though only partiallysuccessful techniques are available.  git-graph isomorphism tester-incorporates a variety of processesthat attempt to narrow down the search for an isomorphism, or to demonstrate that none exists.  no onescheme is relied upon exclusively for a solution, and the program is designed to avoid excessive computationalong fruitless lines.  git has been written in the comit language and successfully tested on the ibm .cacm january, unger, s. h.ca jb march ,   : am
