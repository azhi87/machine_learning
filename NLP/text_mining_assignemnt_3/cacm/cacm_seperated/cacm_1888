spline function methods for nonlinear boundary-value problems.wthe solution of the nonlinear differential equationy"=f(x,y,y') with two-point boundary conditions is approximated by a quintic or cubic spline functiony(x).  the method is well suited to nonuniform mesh size and dynamic mesh size allocation.  for uniformmesh size h, the error in the quintic spline y(x) is o(h^), with typical error one-third that fromnumerov's method.  requiring the differential equation to be satisfied at the mesh points resultsin a set of difference equations, which are block tridiagonal and so are easily solved by relaxation or other standard methods.cacm june, blue, j. l..kboundary value problems, differential equations,finite differences, functional approximation, iterative methods, nonlinear equations, spline functions.c. . .ca jb february ,   : am
