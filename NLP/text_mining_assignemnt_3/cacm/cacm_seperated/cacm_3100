an interference matching technique for inducing abstractions.wa method for inducing knowledge by abstractionfrom a sequence of training examples is described.  the proposed method, interference matching, induces abstractionsby finding relational properties common to two or more exemplars.  three tasks solved by a programthat uses an interference-matching algorithm are presented.  several problems concerning the descriptionof the training examples and the adequacy of interference matching are discussed, and directionsfor future research are considered.cacm may, hayes-roth, f.mcdermott, j..krule induction, knowledge acquisition, partialmatching, interference, graph matching, learning, induction, knowledge representation, informal retrieval,abstraction, generalization, language learning, complexity, predicate discovery..c. . . . . .ca dh february ,   : pm
