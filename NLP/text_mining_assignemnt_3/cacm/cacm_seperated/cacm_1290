transparent-mode control procedures for datacommunication, using the american standard code for information interchange -a tutorial.wthis paper gives the considerations of taskgroup x.. in the area of transparent-mode data communication control philosophy.  the appearance of thispaper was forecast (underthe name of "second-level control") in the earlier tutorial paper, "control proceduresfor data communications," task group document x..., dated may .  the present paper elaboratesupon solutions to the problems of transparency to the basic ascii communication control charactersas outlined in the previous paper mentioned above.  moreover, it goes on to cover the additional control problemsof handling material such as off line encrypted data or non-ascii codes by means of systems providingcomplete character transparency.  it does not cover concepts of transparency in which the normal characterstructure or modulation rate of a system may be abandoned.  in conjunction with the earlier tutorialpaper, this paper is expected to lead to a proposal for stand ardizationof data communication control proceduresusing the american stand ard code for information interchange.cacm april, ca jb march ,   : pm
