on coordination reduction and sentence analysis.wa class of coordination phenomena in naturallanguages is considered within the frame work of transformational theory.  to account for these phenomenait is proposed that certain machinery be added to the syntactic component of a transformationalgrammar. this machinery includes certain rule schemata, the conditions under which they are to beapplied, and conditions determining the sequence of subtrees on which they are to be performed.  a solutionto the syntactic analysis problem for this class of grammars is outlined.  precise specificationof both the generative procedure of this paper and its inverse is given in the form of lisp function definitions.cacm april, petrick, s. r.postal, p. m.rosenbaum, p. s..knatural languages, generative grammar, transformationaltheory, syntax, coordination, sentence coordination, sentence coordination, coordination reduction,syntactic analysis, grammar testing program, rule testing.c.ca jb february ,   : pm
