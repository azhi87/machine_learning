a high security log-in procedure.wthe protection of time sharing systems fromunauthorized users is often achieved by the use of passwords.  by using one-way ciphers to code the passwords,the risks involved with storing the passwords in the computer can be avoided.  we discuss the selectionof a suitable one-way cipher and suggest that for this purpose polynomials over a prime modulus aresuperior to one-way ciphers derived from sannon codes.cacm august, purdy, g. b..koperating systems, time sharing systems, security, cryptography.c.ca jb january ,   : am
