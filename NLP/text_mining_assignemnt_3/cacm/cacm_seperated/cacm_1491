euler: a generalization algol, and its formal definition: part i*.wa method for defining programming languages isdeveloped which introduces a rigorous relationship between structure and meaning.  the structure of alanguage is defined by a phrase structure syntax, the meaning in terms of the effects which the executionof a sequence of interpretation rules exerts upon a fixed set of variables, called the environment. there exists a one-to-one correspondence between syntactic rules and interpretation rules is determined bythe sequence of corresponding syntactic reductions which constitute a parse.  the individual interpretationrules are explained in terms of an elementary an d obvious algorithmic notation.  a constructivemethod for evaluating a text is provided, and for certain decidable classes of languages their unambiguityis proved.  as an example, a generalization of algol is described in full detail to demonstrate thatconcepts like block-structure, procedures, parameters, etc. can be defined adequately and precisely by this method.cacm january, wirth, n.weber, h.ca jb march ,   : pm
