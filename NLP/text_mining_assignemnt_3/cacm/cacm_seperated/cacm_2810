professionalism in the computing field.wthe term professional means different thingsto different people; nevertheless, there are certain general technical and social standards normally associatedwith a professional.  further, the term is more generally applied to the practitioner rather thanto the researcher.  but within the rather broad definition specified, the computing practitioner is,as yet, not regarded as a professional.  each of the four types of institutions-academic, industry, government,and the professional society- that educate,employ, regulate, and mold the practitioner contributesto the "nonprofessional" status of the computing practitioner.  the roles of these institutions are examined,various shortcomings are noted, and recommended changes are suggested.  in the last analysis, professionalstatus is not bestowed; it is earned.  however, universities and industry, specifically, can make certain improvements to help the computing practitioner achieve professional status.cacm january, finerman, a..kprofessional aspects, educational programs, industryattitudes, professional societies, licensing and certification.c. . .ca jb january ,   : am
