a formal system for information retrieval from files.wa generalized file structure is providedby which the concepts of keyword, index, record, file, directory,file structure, directory decoding, and record retrieval are definedand from which some of the frequently used file structures suchas inverted files, index-sequential files, and multilist files arederived.  two algorithms which retrieve records from the generalized file structure are presented.cacm february, hsiao, d..kattribute-value pair, index, keyword, record, record address,k-pointer, k-list, file, directory, generalized filestructure, inverted file, index-sequential-file, multilist file,description, file search, directory search, serial processing oflists, prime keyword, parallel processing of lists .c. . .ca jb february ,   : pm
