on simulating networks of parallel processesin which simultaneous events may occur.wsome of the problems of simulating discreteevent systems, particularly computer systems, on a conventional digital computer are dealt with.  thesystems are assumed to be described as a network of interconnected sequential processes.  briefly reviewedare the common techniques used to handle such simulations when simultaneous events do not occur, canbe ignored, or can be handled by simple priority rules.  following this, the problem of dealing with simultaneousevents in separate processes is introduced.  an abstraction of this problem is developed which admitssolution for a majority of commonly encounteredproblems.  the technique will either find a method ofsimulating the parallel events or report that none can be found.  in some of the latter cases it is shownto be possible to find a solution by extending the information available to the solution technique, butin many cases the technique becomes computationally unfeasible when the additional information is provided.cacm september, parnas, d. l..ksimulation, parallel processes, simultaneous events,picture processing, computer system simulation.c. . . . .ca jb february ,   : pm
