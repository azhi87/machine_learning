a rapid method for digital filtering.wsince much of the computer time spent in time-seriesanalysis is used for multiplications, a minimum multiplication method was devised for digitalfiltering, with the expectation that it would be useful in the on line, real-time analysis of biologicaldata.  the filters are constructed from a succession of readily analyzable components in a manner that facilitatescascading.  the repertoire of frequency response curves includes relatively good low-pass andband-pass designs.  programs are available for implementing both the synthesis of these filters, andtheir application on computers whose assemblers allow the definition of recursive macros.cacm september, whittlesey, j. r. b.ca jb march ,   : pm
