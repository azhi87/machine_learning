an efficient machine-independent procedure forgarbage collection in various list structures.wa method for returning registers to the freelist is an essential part of any list processing system.  in this paper, past solutions of the recoveryproblem are reviewed and compared.  a new algorithm is presented which offers significant advantages of speedand storage utilization.  the routine for implementing this algorithm can be written in the list language withwhich it is to be used, thus insuring a degree of machine independence.  finally, the application of thealgorithm to a number of different list structures appearing in the literature is indicated.cacm august, schorr, h.waite, w. m.ca jb february ,   : pm
