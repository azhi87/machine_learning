an exponential method for the solution ofsystems of ordinary differential equations .wan explicit, coupled, single-step method forthe numerical solution of initial value problems for systems of ordinary differential equations is presented. the method was designed to be general purpose in nature but to be especially efficient when dealingwith stiff systems of differential equations.  it is, in general, second order except for the caseof a linear system with constant coefficients and linear forcing terms; in that case, the method is thirdorder.  it has been implemented and put to routine usage in biological applications-where stiffness frequentlyappears-with favorable results.  when compared to a standard fourth order runge-kutta implementation,computation time required by this method has ranged from comparable for certain nonstiff problems to betterthan two orders of magnitude faster for some highly stiff systems.cacm december, chu, s. c.berman, m..knumerical solution, ordinary differential equations,initial value problems, stiff systems.c.ca jb january ,   : pm
