logic and semantic networks.wan extended form of semantic network is defined, which canbe regarded as a syntactic variant of the clausal form of logic.by virtue of its relationship with logic, the extendedsemantic network is provided with a precise semantics,inference rules, and a procedural interpretation.  onthe other hand, by regarding semantic networks as an abstract data structure for the representation of clauses, we provide atheorem-prover with a potentially useful indexing scheme and path-followingstrategy for guiding the search for a proof.cacm march, deliyanni, a.kowalski, r.a..klogic, semantic networks, theorem-proving, indexing, resolution, deduction, logic programming.c. . .ca dh april ,   : pm
