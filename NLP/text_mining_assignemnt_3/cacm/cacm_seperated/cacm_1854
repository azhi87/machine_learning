on multiprogramming, machine coding, and computer organization.wthe author feels that the interrupt featurewhich is available in most modern computers is a potent source of programming pitfalls and errors, andthat it therefore may heavily contribute to the unreliability of programs making use of it.  a programmingscheme is presented which avoids the concept of the interrupt and permits the specification of concurrent(or pseudoconcurrent) activities in a supposedly more perspicuous manner.  it is intended to serve asa basis for the construction of operating systems, which are prime examples of programs with concurrentactivities.  the scheme includes a set of basic instructions for the generation, termination, and synchronizationof parallel processes.  a set of routines representing these instructions and thereby simulating ahypothetical machine organization has been implemented and test on the ibm system/.  two programs using theseinstructions, written in pl, are presented. cacm september, wirth, n..kmultiprogramming, parallelism, interrupt, input-output,computer organization, file handling, pl.c. . . . .ca jb february ,   : pm
