a multiprogramming monitor for small machines.wint, a combination hardware/software monitordesigned to control a wide variety of real-time input/output devices, is described.  the simple hardwareadditions provide a uniform device to machine interface for such elements as keyboards graphic inputdevices, and interval timers.  the software relieves the user program from the details of input/output timing,buffering, and task scheduling and provides parallel processing capability.  user programs communicatewith the monitor through a small set of meta-instruction which consists mostly of machine-language subroutine calls.cacm may, hornbuckle, g. d.ca jb february ,   : am
