the use of quadratic residue research.wa quadratic residue search method has previously been suggestedto avoid the clustering usually encountered when hash address collisionsoccur and linear search methods are used.  the search size, becauseof the property of quadratic residues, is limited to one half ofthe storage table.  it is shown that for some classes of prime numbersthe complement of the set of quadratic residues can easily be determined and hence the entire table of size p, where p is that prime number, can be searched.cacm february, radke, c. e..kquadratic residue, search method, hash addressing, addressclustering, scatter storage, file searching, fileaddressing, hash coding, quadratic search,random search, storage layout, searching.c. . .ca jb february ,   : am
