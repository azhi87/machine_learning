an experimental comparison of time sharing and batch processing.wthe effectiveness for program developmentof the mit compatible time-sharing system (ctss) was compared with that of the ibm ibsys batch-processingsystem by means of a statistically designed experiment.  an identical set of four programming problemswas assigned to each of a group of four programming subjects.  influences external to the systems, such asthe sequence of problem solution, and programmer and problem characteristics, were specified as designfactors in the experiment.  data was obtained for six variables (e.g., programmer time, computer time,elapsed time, etc.) which were considered to be definitive of "system effectiveness," and analysis ofvariance techniques were employed to estimate system differences in these variables after differences due tothe design factors had been eliminated.  statistical analysis of the experimental results provided strongevidence of important system differences, as well as a critique of the experimental design itselfwith implications for further experimentation.cacm may, schatzoff, m.tsao, r.wiig, r.ca jb february ,   : am
