an algorithm for hidden line elimination.wthe algorithm presented causes the elimination ofhidden lines in the representation of a perspective view of concave and convex plane-faced objects on thepicture plane.  all the edges of the objects are considered sequentially, and all planes which hide everypoint of an edge are found.  the computing time increases roughly as the square of the number of edges. the algorithm takes advantage of a reduced number of concave points and automatically recognizes if onlyone object with no concave points is considered. in this last case, the result is obtained in a much simpler way.cacm april, galimberti, r.montanari, u..khidden line elimination, back line recognition, three-dimensionalrepresentation, plane-faced objects, perspective view, machine rendering of solids, automaticdrawing, displaying techniques, computer graphics, man/machine interaction, man/machine communication, computer-aided design.c. . .ca jb february ,   : pm
