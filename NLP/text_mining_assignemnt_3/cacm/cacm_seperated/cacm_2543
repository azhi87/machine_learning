reducing the retrieval time of scatter storage techniques.wa new method for entering and retrieving informationin a hash table is described.  the method is intended to be efficient if most entries are lookedup several times.  the expected number of probes to look up an entry, predicted theoretically and verifiedby monte carlo experiments, is considerably less than for other comparable methods if the tableis nearly full.  an example of a possible fortran implementation is given.cacm february, brent, r. p..kaddress calculation, content addressing, file searching,hash addressing, hash code, linear probing, linear quotient method, scatter storage, searching, symbol table.c. . . . .ca jb january ,   : pm
