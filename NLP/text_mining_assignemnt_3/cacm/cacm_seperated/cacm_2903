improving programs by the introduction of recursion.wa new technique of program transformation,called "recursion in troduction," is described and applied to two algorithms which solve pattern matching problems. by using recursion in troduction, algorithms which manipulate a stack are first translated intorecursive algorithms in which no stack operations occur.  these algorithms are then subjected to a secondtransformation, a method of recursion elimination called "tabulation," to produce programs with a veryefficient running time.  in particular, it is shown how the fast linear pattern matching algorithm of knuth,morris, and pratt can be derived in a few steps from a simple nonlinear stack algorithm.cacm november, bird, r. s..kprogram transformation, optimization of programs,recursion elimination, pattern matching algorithms, stacks, computational induction.c. . . . .ca jb december ,   : am
