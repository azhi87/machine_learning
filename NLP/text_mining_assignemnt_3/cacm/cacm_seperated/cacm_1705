a set of basic input-output procedures (algorithm  []).wby means of the primitives in symbol, outsymboland length, as requested by this journal's algorithms policy [comm. acm  (nov. ), ] a basicset of input-output procedures is defined aiming at quality and flexibility.  outreal, for instance, iswritten as a derived procedure; it outputs using the fixed point or the floating point representation,and rounds properly.  variants can easily be written because of the explicit call of the procedures decomposeinteger and decompose real.  the highly recommended practice of echoing input is made easy with one subsetof derived procedures (ioi, ior, iob, ioa).  the documentation of output in the form of equivalent algolstatements is also provided when use is made of the subset oti, otr, otb, ota.  the berkeley styleof providing information on the form of output using prior calls of procedures such as real format isdefined.  a use of the parameter outchannel to provide information for simultaneous output to severalchannels is suggested.  interrelationship between the declared procedures is furnished in tabular form.cacm august, de vogelaere, r..kinput output, transput, input output procedures,input echo, quality output, decompose integer, decompose real, style, berkeley style, procedures relationship,output documentation, equivalent algol statements, algol, algol , integer format, real format,outinteger, read real, input output boolean, input output array, fixed point representation, floatingpoint representation, output channel interpretation.c. .ca jb february ,   : am
