on the implementation of security measures in information systems.wthe security of an information system may berepresented by a model matrix whose elements are decision rules and whose row and column indices areusers and data items respectively.  a set of four functions is used to access this matrix at translationand execution time.  distinguishing between data dependent and data independent decision rules enablesone to perform much of the checking of security only once at translation time rather than repeatedlyat execution time.  the model is used to explain security features of several existing systems, and servesas a framework for a proposal for general security system implementation within today's languages and operating systems.cacm april, conway, r. w.maxwell, w. l.morgan, h. l..ksecurity, privacy, access control confidentiality,operating systems, access management, data banks, management information systems.c. . . . .ca jb january ,   : pm
