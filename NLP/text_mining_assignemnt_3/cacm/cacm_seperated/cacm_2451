design of tree structures for efficient querying.wa standard information retrieval operation isto determine which records in a data collection satisfy a given query expressed in terms of data values. the process of locating the desired responses can be represented by a tree search model.  this paperposes an optimization problem in the design of such trees to serve a well-specified application. theproblem is academic in the sense that ordinarily the optimal tree cannot be implemented by means of practicaltechniques.  on the other hand, it is potentially useful for the comparison it affords between observedperformance and that of an intuitively attractive ideal search procedure.  as a practical applicationof such a model this paper considers the design of a novel tree search scheme based on a bit vector representationof data and shows that essentially the same algorithm can be used to design either an idealsearch tree or a bit-vector tree.  an experimental study of a small formatted file illustrates the concepts.cacm september, casey, r. g..ktree file, information storage and retrieval, clustering,search, data structure, data management, query answering.c. .ca jb january ,   : am
