mechanization of tedious algebra-thee coefficients of theoretical chemistry.wa table of formulas for certain integralsinvolving legendre functions has been constructed mechanically by a program which performed algebraic operations. the formulas are all rational algebraic expressions in a single variable and were constructedby a recurrence procedure.  they are of interest in molecular quantum chemistry.  trivial coding techniqueswere used to write the relevant programs in fortran.  the results were photo composed on a photons- system, that was controlled by tapes which were punched directly from the computer output, soavoiding manual keyboarding, transcription errors and keyboarded correction.cacm december, wactlar, h. d.barnett, m. p.ca jb march ,   : pm
