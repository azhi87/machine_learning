vmin-an optimal variable-space page replacement algorithm.wa criterion for comparing variable space pagereplacement algorithms is presented.  an optimum page replacement algorithm, called vmin, is described andshown to be optimum with respect to this criterion. the results of simulating vmin, denning's working set,and the page partitioning replacement algorithms on five virtual memory programs are presented to demonstratethe improvement possible over the known realizable variable space algorithms.cacm may, prieve, b. g.fabry, r. s..kdemand paging, performance measurement, multilevelmemory systems, virtual memory, working set, page replacement algorithms, optimal page replacement.c. .ca jb january ,   : pm
