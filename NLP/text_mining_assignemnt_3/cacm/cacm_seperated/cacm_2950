a unifying approach to scheduling.wthis paper presents a scheme for classifyingscheduling algorithms based on an abstract model of a scheduling system which formalizes the notion ofpriority.  various classes of scheduling algorithmsare defined and related to existing algorithms.  acriterion for the implementation efficiency of an algorithm is developed and results in the definitionof time-invariant algorithms, which include most of the commonly implemented ones.  for time-invariantalgorithms, the dependence of processing rates on priorities is derived.  the abstract model providesa framework for implementing flexible schedulers in real operating systems.  the policy-driven schedulerof bernstein and sharp is discussed as an example of such an implementationcacm july, ruschitzka, m.fabry, r. s..kscheduling algorithms, scheduling models, priority,operating systems,processor sharing, implementation efficiency.c. . . . .ca jb december ,   : pm
