synchronization of communicating processes.wformalization of a well-defined synchronizationmechanism can be used to prove that concurrently running processes of a system communicate correctly. this is demonstrated for a system consisting of many sending processes which deposit messages in a bufferand many receiving processes which remove messages from that buffer.  the formal description of the synchronizationmechanism makes it very easy to prove that the buffer will neither overflow nor underflow,that senders and receivers will never operate on the same message frame in the buffer nor will they run into a deadlock. cacm march, habermann, a. n..kparallel programming, multiprogramming, program correctness,process communication, process scheduling.c. . . .ca jb january ,   : pm
