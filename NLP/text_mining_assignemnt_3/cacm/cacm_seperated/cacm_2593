a back-end computer for data base management.wit is proposed that the data base managementfunction be placed on a dedicated back-end computer which accepts commands (in a relatively high level languagesuch as the codasyl data base task group, april  report) from a host computer, accesses thedata base on secondary storage, and returns results.  the advantages of such a configuration are discussed.  anexperimental implementation, called the experimental data management system, xdms, is described and certainconclusions about the back-end approach are drawn from this implementation.cacm october, canaday, r. h.harrison, r. d.ivie, e. l.ryder, j. l.wehr, l. a..kdata base management, information retrieval, computerconfigurations, computer networks, data base task group language, data base protection,data base portability, back-end computer.c. . . .ca jb january ,  : pm
