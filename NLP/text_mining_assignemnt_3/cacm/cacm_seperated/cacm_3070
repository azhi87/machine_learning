hybrid simulation models of computer systems.wthis paper describes the structure and operationof a hybrid simulation model in which both discrete-event simulation and analytic techniques arecombined to produce efficient yet accurate system models.  in an example based on a simple hypotheticalcomputer system, discrete-event simulation is used to model the arrival and activation of jobs, and acentral-server queueing network models the use of system processors.  the accuracy and efficiency of thehybrid technique are demonstrated by comparing the result and computational costs of the hybrid model ofthe example with those of an equivalent simulation-only model.  cacm september, schwetman, h.d..kperformance evaluation, simulation, queueingnetwork models, central server model.c. . .ca dh february ,   : pm
