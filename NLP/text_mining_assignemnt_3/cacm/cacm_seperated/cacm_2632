hydra: the kernel of a multiprocessor operating system.wthis paper describes the design philosophy ofhydra-the kernel of an operating system for c.mmp, the carnegie-mellon multi-mini-processor.  this philosophyis realized through the introduction of a generalized notion of "resource", both physical and virtual,called an "object".  mechanisms are presented for dealing with objects, including the creation of newtypes, specification of new operations applicable to a given type, sharing, and protection of any referenceto a given object against improper application of any of the operations defined with respect to thattype of object.  the mechanisms provide a coherent basis for extension of the system in two directions: theintroduction of new facilities, and the creation of highly secure systems. cacm june, wulf, w.cohen, e.corwin, w.jones, a.levin, r.pierson, c.pollack, f..koperating system, kernel, nucleus, protection, security.c. .ca jb january ,   : pm
