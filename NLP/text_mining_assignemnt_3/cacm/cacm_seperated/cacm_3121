syntactic source to source transforms and program manipulation.wsyntactic transforms are the source to source program transformationswhich preserve the history of computation, and thus do notmodify the execution time.  combined with a small number of primitivesemantic transforms, they provide a powerful tool for programmanipulation.  a catalogue of syntactic transforms, and its use forsolution of a system of program equations, is given.  examples ofderivation of more complex source to source transformations are alsopresented.  two case studies illustrate the way in which syntactic and semantic source to source transformations may be used fordevelopment of clear, simple, and reasonably efficient programs.cacm january, arsac, j.j..kstructured programming, program transforms, control structures.c. . .ca dh april ,   : pm
