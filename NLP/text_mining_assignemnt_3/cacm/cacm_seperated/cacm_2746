efficient string matching: an aid to bibliographic search.wthis paper describes a simple, efficient algorithmto locate all occurrences of any of a finite number of keywords in a string of text.  the algorithmconsists of constructing a finite state pattern matching machine from the keywords and then using thepattern matching machine to process the text string in a single pass.  construction of the pattern matchingmachine takes time proportional to the sum of the lengths of the keywords.  the number of state transitionsmade by the pattern matching machine in processing the text string is independent of the numberof keywords.  the algorithm has been used to improve the speed of a library bibliographicsearch program by a factor of  to .cacm june, aho, a. v.corasick, m. j..kkeywords and phrases, string pattern matching, bibliographicsearch, information retrieval, text-editing, finite state machines, computational complexity..c. . . .ca jb january ,   : pm
