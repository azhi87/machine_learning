modeling and simulation of digital networks.wthe simulation of digital networks on a digitalcomputer provides the engineer with an effective means of analyzing time-quantized logical behavior.  thedigital network is modeled as a set of time-dependent or time-independent boolean transformations; each transformationdescribing the input-output relationship of a model element comprising the network mode.  thesimplicity of utilizing the fortran iv programming system as a digital network simulator is discussed anillustrated.  this simplicity is derived from a common modeling technique applicable to combinationaland sequential digital networks and a systematic programming approach.cacm may, larsen, r. p.mano, m. m.ca jb march ,   : pm
