the programmer's workbench-a machine for software development.won almost all software development projects theassumption is made that the program development function will be done on the same machine on which theeventual system will run.  it is only when this production machine is unavailable or when its programmingenvironment is totally inadequate that alternatives are considered.  in this paper it is suggested thatthere are many other situations where it would be advantageous to separate the program development andmain tenance function onto a specialized computer which is dedicated to that purpose.  such a computeris here called a programmer's workbench.  the four basic sections of the paper in troduce the subject,outlinethe general concept, discuss areas where such an approach may prove beneficial, and describean operational system utilizing this concept.cacm october, ivie, e. l..kcomputer configurations, computer networks, softwaredevelopment, software engineering, software main tenance, unix.c. . . . .ca jb december ,   : am
