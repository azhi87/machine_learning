multiprogramming under a page on demand strategy.wa model of multiprogramming for a particularcomputer system using a page on demand strategy is developed.  analysis of this model is used to predictperformance (measured by the average usage of the cpu) when user programs are typical of those arisingfrom an interactive time sharing environment.  the effect of several hardware modifications is alsoanalyzed.  a parameter, readily calculated from the hardware characteristics and the program statistics,is proposed for gauging the effect of multiprogramming.cacm october, smith, j. l.ca jb february ,   : pm
