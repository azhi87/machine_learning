multilevel operating systems.wthe basic software for all newer computersis built on the well-established need for standard operating systems. this implies that all applications-nomatter how large, complex or time consuming-must operate under (or, more precisely, on top of) the standardsystem.  large applications require supervisory monitors which handle problems similar to those ofthe operating systems, but at a different level.  sometimes, still a third or even a fourth such levelis required or desirable.  this leads naturally to the concept of multilevel systems-similar vertically,but different horizontally.  proper division of responsibility between levels leads to greater efficiency andless logical complexity, while actually enhancing capability.cacm march, orchard-hays, w.ca jb march ,   : pm
