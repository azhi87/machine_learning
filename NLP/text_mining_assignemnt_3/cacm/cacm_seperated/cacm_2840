protection in operating systems.wa model of protection mechanisms in computingsystems is presented and its appropriateness is argued.  the "safety" problem for protection systemsunder this model is to determine in a given situation whether a subject can acquire a particular right toan object.   in restricted cases, it can be shown that this problem is decidable, i.e. there is an algorithmto determine whether a system in a particular configuration is safe.  in general, and under surprisinglyweak assumptions, it cannot be decided if a situation is safe. various implications of this fact are discussed.cacm august, harrison, m. a.ruzzo, w. l.ullman, j. d..kprotection, protection system, operatingsystem, decidability, turing machine.c. . .ca jb january ,   : am
