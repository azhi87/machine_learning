an optimal method for deletion in one-sided height-balanced trees.wa one-sided height-balanced tree is a binarytree in which every node's right subtree has a height which is equal to or exactly one greater than theheight of its left subtree.  it has an advantage over the more general avl tree in that only one bitof balancing information is required (two bits are required for the acl tree).  it is shown that deletion ofan arbitrary node of such a tree can be accomplished in o(logn) operations, where n is the number of nodesin the tree.  moreover the method is optimal in the sense that its complexity cannot be reduced in orderof magnitude.  this result, coupled with earlier results by hirschberg, indicates that, of the three basicproblems of insertion, deletion, and retrieval, only insertion is adversely affected by this modification of an avl tree.   cacm june, zweben, s.h.mcdonald, m.a..kbalanced, binary, search, trees.c. . . . .ca dh february ,   : pm
