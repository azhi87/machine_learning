on computing the fast fourier transform.wcooley and tukey have proposed a fast algorithmfor computing complex fourier transform and have shown major time savings in using it to computelarge transforms on a digital computer.  with n a power of two, computing time for this algorithm isproportional to n log n, a major improvement over other methods with computing time proportional to n^. in this paper, the fast fourier transform algorithm is briefly reviewed and fast difference equation methodsfor accurately computing the needed trigonometric function values are given.  the problem of computinga large fourier transform on a system with virtual memory is considered, and a solution is proposed.  thismethod has been used to compute complex fourier transforms of size n = ^ on a computer with ^words of core storage; this exceeds by a factor of eight the maximum radix two transform size with fixedallocation of this amount of core storage.  the method has also been used to compute large mixed radixtransforms.  a scaling plan for computing the fast fourier transform with fixed-point arithmetic is also given.cacm october, singleton, r. c.ca jb february ,   : pm
