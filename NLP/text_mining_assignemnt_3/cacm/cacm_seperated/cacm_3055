an analysis of algorithms for the dutch national flag problem.wsolutions to the dutch national flag problemhave been given by dijkstra [] and meyer [].  dijkstra starts with a simple program and arrives atan improved program by refinement.  both of the algorithms given by dijkstra are shown to have an expected numberof swaps which is /n + () and that these values differ at most by / of a swap and asymptoticallyby / of a swap.  the algorithm of meyer is shown to have expected swap complexity /n.cacm october, mcmaster, c.l..kalgorithmic analysis, dutch national flagproblem, refinement, structured programming.c. . . .ca dh january ,   : pm
