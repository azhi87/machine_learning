flowtrace, a computer program for flowcharting programs.wthe flowtrace system produces flowcharts of programswritten in "almost any" programming language.  one most describe the syntax of the control statementsin his language; for this purpose a metalanguage is available.  the resultant object deck is used toflowchart any programs in the language described.  several examples of fap and snobol flowcharts are given. however, it is not necessary to confine one's scope to existing languages.  one may define his ownlanguage in any "well-structured" manner.  this feature is particularly useful when it is desirableto chart only comments within a program.  such an approach permits the documentation of descriptive remarksand avoids the inclusion of coding details.cacm december, sherman, p. m.ca jb march ,   : pm
