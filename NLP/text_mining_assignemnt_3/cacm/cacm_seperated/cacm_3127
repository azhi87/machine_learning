thoth, a portable real-time operating system .wthoth isa real-time operating system which is designed to be portableover a large set of machines.  it is currently running on two minicomputerswith quite different architectures.  both the system and applicationprograms which use it are written in a high-level language.because the system is implemented by the same software on differenthardware, it has the same interface to user programs.  hence,application programs which use thoth are  highly portable.  thothencourages structuring programs as networks of communicating processes by providing efficient interprocess communication primitives.cacm february, cheriton, d.r.malcolm, m.a.melen, l.a.sager, g.r..kportability, real time, operating systems, minicomputer.c. . .ca dh april ,   : am
