logic-structure tables.wlogic tables are an excellent way of developingand expressing the logic required in procedures, operations, systems and circuits.  a set of rules forwriting and using logic tables is explained by means of some simple examples.  then the logic structureof a vending machine is given in which two logic tables are used.  logic tables are two-dimensional innature, enabling us to fully express and consider both the sequential and parallel aspects of logic.  theycan be compiled directly into a computer program and so eliminate the need for flow charting and hand coding.cacm june, cantrell, h. n.king, j.king, f. e. h.ca jb march ,   : pm
