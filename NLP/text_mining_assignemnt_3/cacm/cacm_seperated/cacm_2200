on complement division.wthe division algorithm theorem is expressedin a form that permits it to serve as the basis for devising division operations that produce both quotientand remainder in complement form.  algorithms for division yielding complement results are derivedfor numbers represented in any base greater than one.  both radix and radix-less-one complementation schemesare considered.  the binary form of the algorithms thus includes both two's and one's complement implementation. the problem of quotient overflow for complement results is dealt with as is that of selecting an appropriateform of the remainder condition for complement division. cacm april, stein, m. l.munro, w. d..kdivision algorithm, complement arithmetic, complementdivision, one's complement arithmetic, two's complement arithmetic.c. . . . .ca jb february ,   : pm
