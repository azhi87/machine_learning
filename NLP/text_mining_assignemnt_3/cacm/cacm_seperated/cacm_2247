on the criteria to be used in decomposing systems into modules.wthis paper discusses modularization as a mechanismfor improving the flexibility ad comprehensibility of a system while allowing the shortening of its developmenttime.  the effectiveness of a "modularization" is dependent upon the criteria used in dividing thesystem into modules.  a system design problem ispresented and both a conventional and unconventionaldecomposition are described.  it is shown that the unconventional decompositions have distinct advantagesfor the goals outlined.  the criteria used in arriving at the decompositions are discussed.  theunconventional decomposition, if implemented with the conventional assumption that a module consists ofone or more subroutines, will be less efficient in most cases.  an alternative approach to implementationwhich does not have this effect is sketched.cacm december, parnas, d. l..ksoftware, modules, modularity, softwareengineering, kwic index, software design.c.ca jb january ,   : am
