a boolean matrix method for the computationof linear precedence functions.wa modified version of bell's boolean matrixmethod for the computation of linear precedence functions associated with a conflict-free matrix ofprecedence relations is given.  this algorithm not only detects when the precedence functions do not  exist,but also provides an indication of why they do not exist, so that corrective action can be takenif possible.  necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of precedence functions are given. the use of boolean matrices to prove the existence of precedence functions associated with classes of conflict-freegrammars is illustrated through an example.cacm june, martin, d. f..kprecedence grammars, context-free parsing.c.ca jb january ,   : pm
