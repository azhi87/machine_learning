a stochastic evaluation model for databaseorganization in data retrieval systems.wexperimental work in the valuation of largescale data retrieval systems has been scarce due to its difficulty and prohibitive cost. this paperdiscusses a simulation model of a data retrieval system which has the effect of significantly reducingthe cost of experimentation and enabling research never attempted before.  the model is designed to estimatethe retrieval workload of alternative data retrieval systems.  these data retrieval systems canbe organized under several database organizations, including inverted list, threaded list, and cellularlist organizations and hybrid combinations of these systems.  effectiveness of the methodology is demonstratedby using the model to study the effect of database organizations in data retrieval systems.  in particular,the impact of query complexity is analyzed.cacm february, siler, k. f..kdatabase architecture, database performance andevaluation, invented list, threaded list, cellular list, information retrieval, database organizations,query complexity, stochastic model, monte carlo simulation.c. . . . . .ca jb january ,   : am
