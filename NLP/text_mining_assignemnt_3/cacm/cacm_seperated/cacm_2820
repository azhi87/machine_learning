the design and implementation of a table driven,interactive diagnostic programming system.wcaps is a highly interactive diagnostic compiler/interpreterthat allows beginning programmers to prepare, debug, and execute fairly simple programsat a graphics display terminal.  complete syntax checking and most semantic analysis is performed asthe program is entered and as it is subsequentlyedited.  analysis is performed character by character. the most remarkable feature of caps is its ability to automatically diagnose errors both at compile timeand at run time.  errors are not automatically corrected.  instead, caps interacts with the student to helphim find the cause of his error.  most components of caps are table driven, both to reduce the space neededfor implementation and to increase the flexibility of the multilingual system.  over  students have usedcaps to learn fortran, pl/i, or cobolin conjunction with a computer assisted course on introductory computer science.cacm november, wilcox, t. r.davis, a. m.tindall, m. h..kinteractive programming, table driven compilers,error correction, interpreters, debugging, computer assisted instruction, computer science education.c. . . . .ca jb january ,   : pm
