mechanization of tedious algebra: thenewcomb operators of planetary theory.wa computer program has been written to generatetables of formulas for the newcomb operators of planetary theory.  the newcomb operators are expressedas polynomials in two variables, one of which stands for a simple differential operator, and the otherfor an arbitrary integer.  the polynomials are generated by a recurrence scheme.  the program is coded infortran, using simple array manipulation techniques to perform the algebraic operations.  formulas for over newcomb operators have been produced by the program and typeset photographically on an s- photon system.cacm january, gerard, j. m.izsak, i. g.barnett, m. p.ca jb march ,   : pm
