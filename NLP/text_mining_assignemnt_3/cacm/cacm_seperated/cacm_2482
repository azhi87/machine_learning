mixed solutions for the deadlock problem.wmixtures of detection, avoidance, and preventionprovide more effective and practical solutions to the deadlock problem than any one of these alone.  theindividual techniques can be tailored for subproblems of resource allocation and still operate together toprevent deadlocks.  this paper presents a method, based on the concept of the hierarchical operatingsystem, for constructing appropriate mixtures and suggests appropriate subsystems for the most frequentlyoccurring resource allocation problemscacm july, howard, j. h. jr..kdeadlocks, resource allocation, operating systems,multiprogramming, hierarchical systems.c. .ca jb january ,   : pm
