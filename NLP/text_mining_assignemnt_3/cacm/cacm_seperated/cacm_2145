automation of etching-pattern layout.whelp (heuristic etching-pattern layout program)is an application program developed to computerize the tedious and error-prone although vitally importantwiring design of printed circuit boards.  help helps automate a design stage one step closer to productionthan logical design.  it can be used to design wiring patterns of two-layer circuit boards on whichics in dual-in-line packages as well as discrete components such as transistors and resistors have beenplaced.  help employs two methods of wiring.  one is the heuristic method, which simulates humanapproaches to wiring design, and the other is the theoretically interesting but time-consuming method ofmaze-running, based on the lee's algorithm.  help performs more than  percent of required wiring bythe heuristic path with respect to a performance function for each point-to-point, and point-to-lineconnection.  it can bring the number of successful wiring connections very close to  percent.cacm november, aramaki, i.kawabata, t.kazuhiko, a..kheuristic etching-pattern layout, wiring design ofprinted circuit board, maze-running, lee's algorithm.c. . . .ca jb february ,   : am
