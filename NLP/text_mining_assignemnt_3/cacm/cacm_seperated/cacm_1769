the expanding world of computers.wthe onward sweep of automatic processing ofinformation is impeded by nine principal barriers: geography, cost, problem complexity, man-machine communication,inadequate sensors, lack of understanding, distance, time, and size.  the main incentive for breachingthese barriers is the universal need for processing information, ever more urgent as the greaterpart of human work activity changes from production to service.  computer developments in hardware, programming,time-sharing, education, data communication, and displays are judged by how effectively they remove thesebarriers, and their barrier-smashing potentialities indicate continued rapid expansion.  problem-orientedlanguages are particularly effective over the entire front.  online computers and time-sharing also rate highby this measure.  education and increased understanding are basic to all progress with the computer.  this complexbut powerful tool is the most important one available to governments and scientists to use in studyingthe problems being created by the population explosion, and in analyzing possible solutions.cacm april, harder, e. l..kbarriers, philosophy, developments, computer-aided design,problem-oriented languages, data communication, education, computer science, forecast, survey, introduction.c. . . . . . .ca jb february ,   : am
