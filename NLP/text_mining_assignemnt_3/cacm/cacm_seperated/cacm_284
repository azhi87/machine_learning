manipulation of algebraic expressions.wan algorithm for algebraically manipulatingexpressions of the form sum{cipi, i=,...,n}; has been developed in conjunction with the development of programsfor systems analysis problems.  this algorithm enablesus to derive over-all system transfer functionsfrom algebraically described block diagrams of any linear continuous multi-loop feedback system.  themachine representation of the derived expression, is, by virtue of the algorithm, in a form which simplifiesthe task of compiling.  the algorithm was developed for a particular purpose in connection withsystem analysis studies.  however, its application as a mathematical device extends far beyondthe confines of the original problem.cacm september, rom, a. r. m.ca jb march ,   : pm
