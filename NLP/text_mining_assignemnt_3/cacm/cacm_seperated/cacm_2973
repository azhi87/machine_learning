sorting on a mesh-connected parallel computer.wtwo algorithms are presented for sorting n^elements on an n x n mesh-connected processor array that require o(n) routing and comparison steps. the best previous algorithm takes time o(n log n).  the algorithms of this paper are shown to be optimalin time within small constant factors.  extensions to higher-dimensional arrays are also given.cacm april, thompson, c. d.kung, h. t..kparallel computer, parallel sorting, parallel merge,routing and comparison steps, perfect shuffle. processor in terconnection pattern.c. . .ca jb december ,   : am
