synchronization in a parallel-accessed data base.wthe following problem is considered:  givena data base which can be manipulated simultaneously by more than one process, what are the rules for synchronizationwhich will maximize the amount of parallel activity allowed.  it is assumed that the data basecan be represented as a graph.  an example of such a data base is a hierarchy of directories for an on-linefile system.  methods for synchronization of processes are examined; their validity isdiscussed and their performance compared.cacm november, shoshani, a.bernstein, a. j..kparallel accessing, parallel search, file search,data base, synchronization, locking, deadlock.c. . .ca jb february ,   : pm
