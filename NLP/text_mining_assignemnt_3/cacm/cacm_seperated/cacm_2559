the reallocation of hash-coded tables.wwhen the space allocation for a hash-coded tableis altered, the table entries must be rescattered over the new space.  a technique for accomplishingthis rescattering is presented.  the technique is independent of both the length of the table and the hashingfunction used, and can be utilized in conjunction with a linear reallocation of the table being rescattered. moreover, it can be used to eliminate previously flagged deletions from any hash-coded table, or to changefrom one hashing method to another.  the efficiency of the technique is discussed and theoretical statistics are given.cacm january, bays, c..kreallocation, dynamic storage, hash code, scatter storage, deletions.c. . . .ca jb january ,   : pm
