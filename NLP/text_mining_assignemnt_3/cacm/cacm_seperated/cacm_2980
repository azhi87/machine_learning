the editing  of picture segmentations using local analysis of graphs.wa major problem in picture processing is theelimination of the large number of spurious regions that result from an initial segmentation by region growingtechniques.  such regions have been eliminated either on the basis of semantic information or on thebasis of size and contrast.  a scheme is presented which performs eliminations on the basis of local propertiesof the region adjacency graph.  the scheme is based on definitions of graph properties which aresatisfied when a spurious region is present; then editing is equivalent to fast graph operations.  a number of examples are shown.cacm april, tanimoto, s. l.pavlidis, t..kpicture processing, pattern recognition, segmentation, region editing .c.ca jb december ,   : am
