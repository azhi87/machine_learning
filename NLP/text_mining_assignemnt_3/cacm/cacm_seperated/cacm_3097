optimal shift strategy for a block-transfer ccd memory.wfor the purposes of this paper, a block-transferccd memory is composed of serial shift registers whose shift rate can vary, but which have a definite minimumshift rate (the refresh rate) and a definite maximum shift rate.  the bits iin the shift registersare numbered  to n - , and blocks of n bits are always transferred, always starting at bit .   whatis the best shift strategy so that a block transfer request occurring at a random time will have to wait theminimal amount of time before bit  can be reached?  the minimum shift rate requirement does not allow oneto  simply "park" at bit  and wait for a transfer request.  the optimal strategy involves shifting as slowlyas possible until bit  is passed, then shifting as quickly as possible until a critical boundary isreached, shortly before bit  comes around again.  this is called the "hurry up and wait" strategy and is wellknown outside the computer field.  the block-transfer ccd memory can also be viewed as a paging drumwith a variable (bounded) rotation speed.cacm may,sites, r.l..kpaging drum, charge coupled devices, shift registermemory, memory hierarchy, electronic drum, latency.c. . . .ca dh february ,   : pm
