some performance tests of "quicksort" and descendants.wdetailed performance evaluations are presentedfor six acm algorithms: quicksort (no. ), shellsort (no. ), stringsort (no. ), "treesort"(no. ), quickersort (no. ), and qsort (no. ).  algorithms  and  are refinements of algorithm, and all three are discussed in some detail.  the evidence given here demonstrates that qsort (no.) requires many more comparisons than its author claims.  of all these algorithms, quickersort requiresthe fewest comparisons to sort random arrays.cacm march, loeser, r..ksorting, in-place sorting, sorting efficiency,sorting performance tests, quicksort, quickersort, qsort, shellsort, stringsort, treesort,utility sortalgorithm, general-purpose sort algorithm, sorting algorithm documentation.c. .ca jb january ,   : am
