a stopping criterion for polynomial root finding.wwhen searching for the root of a polynomial,it is generally difficult to know just when to accept a number as an adequate approximation to the root. in this paper an algorithm is presented which allows one to terminate the iteration process on thebasis of calculated bounds for the roundoff error which occurs in evaluating the polynomial.  this stoppingcriterion has been tested on numerous examples and has been found to serve as a satisfactory meansfor accepting a complex number as a zero of a real polynomial.cacm october, adams, d. a.ca jb february ,   : pm
