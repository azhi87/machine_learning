an operating system based on the concept of a supervisory computer.wan operating system which is organized as asmall supervisor and a set of independent processes are described.  the supervisor handles i/o with externaldevices-the file and directory system-schedules active processes and manages memory, handle errors, andprovides a small set of primitive functions which it will execute for a process.  a process is able tospecify a request for a complicated action on the part of the supervisor (usually a wait on the occurrenceof a compound event in the system) by combining these primitives into a "supervisory computer program." the part of the supervisor which executes these programs may be viewed as a software implemented "supervisorycomputer."  the paper develops these concepts in detail, outlines the remainder of the supervisor, anddiscusses some of the advantages of this approach.cacm march, gaines, r. s..koperating systems, supervisors, multiprogramming,time-sharing, cooperating processes.c. . .ca jb january ,   : pm
