tridiagonalization by permutations.wtridiagonalizing a matrix by similarity transformationsis an important computational tool in numerical linear algebra. consider the class of sparsematrices which can be tridiagonalized using only row and corresponding column permutations.  theadvantages of using such a transformation include the absence of round-off errors and improved computation timewhen compared with standard transformations.  a graph theoretic algorithm which examines an arbitraryn x n matrix and determines whether or not it can be permuted into tridiagonal form is given.  thealgorithm requires no arithmetic while the number of comparisons, the number of assignments, and the numberof increments are linear in n.  this compares very favorably with standard transformation methods. if the matrix is permutable into tridiagonal form, the algorithm gives the explicit tridiagonal form. otherwise, early rejection will occur.cacm january, gibbs, n. e.poole, w. g. jr..ktridiagonal matrix, permutation, algorithm,eigenvalues, graph, bandwidth, sparse matrix.c. .ca jb january ,   : pm
