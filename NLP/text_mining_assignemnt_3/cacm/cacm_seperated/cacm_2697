a fast method for solving a class of tridiagonal linear systems.wthe solution of linear systems having real, symmetric,diagonally dominant,tridiagonal coefficient matrices with constant diagonals is considered.  it isproved that the diagonals of the lu decomposition converges when floating-point precision.  it is alsoproved that the computed lu decomposition converges when floating-point arithmetic is used and that the limitsof the lu diagonals using floating point are roughly within machine precision of the limits usingreal arithmetic.  this fact is exploited to reduce the number of floating-point operations required tosolve a linear system from n- to n+k-, where k is much less than n, the order of the matrix.  if theelements of the subdiagonals and superdiagonals are , then only n+k- operations are needed.  theentire lu decomposition takes k words of storage, and considerable savings in array subscripting are achieved. upper and lower bounds on k are obtained in terms of the ratio of the coefficient matrix diagonalconstants and parameters of the floating-point number system.  various generalizations of these results are discussed.cacm january, malcolm, m. a.palmer, j..knumerical linear algebra, linear systems,toeplitz matrices, tridiagonal matrices.c . . . .ca jb january ,   : pm
