a comparison of hardware and software associativememories in the context of computer graphics.wthe associative processing of line drawings (apld)system utilizes a hardware associative memory and creates, modifies, deletes, stores, and retrievestwo-dimensional line drawings consisting of poin ts,lines, rectangles, and triangles. the apld functionswere duplicated on the tx- computer at m.i.t.'s lincoln laboratory under the leap language and datastructure,  a comparison of the hardware approach with the software simulation illustrates the advantagesof the hardware associative memory in three areas: () processing speed, () storage requirements, and ()flexibility.  the major problem areas of hardware associative memory technology, namely input/outputand cost effectiveness, are also addressed.cacm may, stillman, n. j.berra, p. b..kassociative memory, associative processor, content-addressablememory, graphics, information retrieval, data structures, software evaluation, hardware evaluation,parallel processing, database management.c. . . . . . . .ca jb december ,   : am
