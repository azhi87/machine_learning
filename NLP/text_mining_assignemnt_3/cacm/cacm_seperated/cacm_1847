an algorithm for finding a fundamental set of cycles of a graph.wa fast method is presented for finding a fundamentalset of cycles for an undirected finite graph.  a spanning tree is grown and the vertices examinedin turn, unexamined vertices being stored in a pushdown list to await examination.  one stagein the process is to take the top element v of the pushdown list and examine it, i.e. inspect all thoseedges (v,z) of the graph for which z has not yet been examined.  if z is already in the tree, a fundamentalcycle is added; if not, the edge (v,z) is placed in the tree.  there is exactly one such stagefor each of the n vertices of the graph.  for large n, the store required in creases as n^ and the time asn^g where g depends on the type of graph involved.  g is bounded below by  and above by , and it is shownthat both bounds are attained.  in terms of storage our algorithm is similar to that of gotlieb andcorneil and superior to that of welch; in terms of speed it is similar to that of welch and superiorto that of gotlieb and corneil.  testsshow our algorithm to be remarkably efficient (g=) on random graphs.cacm september, paton, k..kfundamental cycle set, graph, algorithm, cycle, spanning tree.c.ca jb february ,   : pm
