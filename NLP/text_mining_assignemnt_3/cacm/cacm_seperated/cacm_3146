an academic program providing realistic training in software engineering.wan academic program at harvey mudd college, calledthe clinic program, brings projects from industry on campus to be studied and solved by student teams.  the objective ofthe clinic is to provide students, working as small teams under careful faculty supervision, an opportunity to work on real worldproblems of sufficient magnitude and complexity.  under this program,students can acquire essential skills of software engineering,such as team work, software project management, software designmethodology, and communication skills, in a realistic environment.sample software projects undertaken by the clinic are described. experience so far has shown that the program is a viabletransition from an academic to industrial world.cacm june, busenberg, s.n.tam, w.c..ksoftware engineering, software engineering education, softwareprojects, student teams, software engineering skills.c. .ca dh august ,   : pm
