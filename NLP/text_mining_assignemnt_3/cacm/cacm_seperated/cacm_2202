dynamic microprogramming: processor organization and programming.wa dynamically microprogrammed processor is characterizedby a small (^k -bit word) read-write "micro" storage.  the access time of this storage issimilar to the cycle time of the machine (- nsec).  this microstorage is used to contain both dataand subroutines.  the (micro) instructions in such a processor differ from the conventional in thatthey perform only purely combinatorial operations; sequencing is under the control of the microinstruction.the presence of the read-write microstorage permits a more flexible assignment of resources than theread-only storage.  in particular, the processor developed in this paper stresses the simultaneous operation(within the microinstruction) of the adder, shifter, masker, and testing facilities of the processor. a microassembly language is developed and the overhead involved in subroutine linkages is analyzed. the efficiency of a flexible software linkage scheme is examined as to its overhead for various subroutinecharacteristics.  finally, three examples of problem-oriented programming are considered and theresulting coding is compared against a system/ assembly language version, with the technology normalized.cacm april, tucker, a. b.flynn, m. j..kmicroprogramming,read-write microstorage,subroutine linkage, execution speed .c.ca jb february ,   : pm
