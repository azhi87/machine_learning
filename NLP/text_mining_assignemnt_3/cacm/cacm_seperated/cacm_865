internal and tape sorting using the replacement-selection technique.wa general technique for sequencing unsortedrecords is presented.  the technique is shown to be applicable for the first stage of a generalized sortprogram (the formation of initial strings) as well as for sorting records within a memory storage (aninternal sort).  it is shown that given n records in memory storage, records are sequenced using +logn tests per record, that initial string lengths will average n for random input records, and that reading,writing and processing can be accomplished simultaneously if the computer permits such overlap.cacm may, goetz, m. a.ca jb march ,   : am
