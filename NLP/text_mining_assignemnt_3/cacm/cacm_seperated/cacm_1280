numerical integration of a differential-differenceequation with a decreasing time-lag.wsystems in which variable time-lags are presentare of common occurrence in biology.  variable flow rates are a common cause of these variable lags. at present no extensive body of knowledge exists concerning the effects which these variable lags cancause.  shown here is a method of reducing some differential-difference equations to ordinary differentialequations which can then be studied numerically with ease.  subsequent study will deal with situationsin which multiple-lags and lags dependent on the solution itself are present.cacm april, bellman, r. e.buell, j. d.kalaba, r. e.ca jb march ,   : pm
