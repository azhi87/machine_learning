storage allocation in a certain iterative process.wa method of core storage allocation in a certainiterative process is described and estimates of the machine time required are given.  the method isapplicable to iterative processes in which input data items once chosen are never again needed.  in thismethod the input data is continuously relocated and the space made available apportioned to the outputtables when an overflow occurs.  some important special cases are considered in which considerable simplification occurs.cacm june, abramowich, j.ca jb february ,   : am
