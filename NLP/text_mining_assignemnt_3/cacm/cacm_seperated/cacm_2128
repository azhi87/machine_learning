a processor allocation method for time-sharing.wa scheduling algorithm is proposed which is intended to minimize changes of tasks on processors and thereby reduce over-head.  the algorithm also hasapplication to more general resource allocation problems.  it is implemented by means of a method for efficiently handling dynamically changing segmented lists.cacm january, mullery, a. p.driscoll, g. c..ktime sharing, resource allocation, scheduling algorithms,monitors, dynamic allocation, processorallocation, multiprogramming, multiprocessing, timeslicing, scheduling, conversational systems, interactive systems .c. . . . .ca jb february ,   : pm
