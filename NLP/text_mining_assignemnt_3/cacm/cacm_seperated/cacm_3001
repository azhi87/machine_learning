detection of combined occurrences.win this paper it is supposed that the variablesx,...,xn each have finite range with the variable xi taking on pi possible values and that the values of thevariables are changing with time.  it is supposed further that it is desired to detect occurrences in whichsome subset of the variables achieve particular values.  finally, it is supposed that the problem involvesthe detection of a large number of combined occurrences for a large number of changes of values ofvariables.  two efficient solutions for this problem are described.  both methods have the unusual propertyof being faster for systems where the sum p + ... + pn is larger. the first solution is error-freeand suitable for most cases.  the second solution is slightly more elegant and allows negation as wellas conjunction, but is subject to the possibility of errors.  an error analysis is given for the secondmethod and an empirical study is reported.cacm january, zobrist, a. l.carlson, f. r. jr..kcoding, hash coding, retrieval, secondary keys, patternrecognition, artificial in telligence, demons, n-tuples, sorting, chess.c. .cajb january ,   : am
