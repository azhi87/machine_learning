a computer generated aid for cluster analysis.wa computer generated graphic method, whichcan be used in conjunction with any hierarchical scheme of cluster analysis, is described and illustrated. the graphic principle used is the representation of the elements of a data matrix of similarities or dissimilaritiesby computer printed symbols (of character overstrikes) of various shades of darkness, where adark symbol corresponds to a small dissimilarity.  the plots, applied to a data matrix before clusteringand to the rearranged matrix after clustering, show at a glance whether clustering brought forth anydistinctive clusters.  a well-known set of data consisting of the correlations of  psychological testsis used to illustrate the comparison of groupings by four methods of factor analysis and two methods of cluster analysis.cacm june, ling, r. f..kcomputer graphics, cluster analysis, numericaltaxonomy, hierarchical clustering, factor analysis.c. . . .ca jb january ,   : pm
