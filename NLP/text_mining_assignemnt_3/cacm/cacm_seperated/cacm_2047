incorporating origin shifts into the qralgorithm for symmetric tridiagonal matrices.wthe qr iteration for the eigenvalues of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix can be accelerated by incorporating a sequence of origin shifts.  the origin shiftmay be either subtracted directly from the diagonal elements ofthe matrix or incorporated by means of an implicit algorithm.  bothmethods have drawbacks: the direct method can unnecessarily degrade small eigenvalues, while the implicit method can effectively loose the shift and thereby retard the convergence.  this paper presents a new method which has neither drawback.cacm june, stewart, g. w..keigenvalues, eigenvectors, qr method, originshifts, symmetric tridiagonal matrix.c.ca jb february ,   : am
