near-minimax polynomial approximations and partitioning of intervals.wa method of near-minimax polynomial approximationis described.  as a by-product, this method provides a formula for an estimate of the maximum errorassociated with a given degree of approximation.  using this formula, a partitioning algorithm is obtainedfor dividing a basic interval into subintervals for which approximations of equal degree give equal maximum error.cacm august, fraser, w.hart, j. f.ca jb march ,   : pm
