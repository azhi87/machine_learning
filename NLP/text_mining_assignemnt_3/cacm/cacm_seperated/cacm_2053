on the conversion of decision tables to computer programs.wthe use of execution time diagnostics in pinpointing ambiguities in decisiontables is discussed.  it is pointed out that any attempt at resolvingambiguities at compile time will, in general, be impossible.  itis shown that, as a consequence, tree methods of converting decisiontables to programs are inadequate in regard to ambiguity detection.two algorithms for programming decision tables whose meritsare simplicity of implementation and detection of ambiguities atexecution time are presented. the first algorithm is for limited entrydecision tables and clarifies the importance of proper codingof the information in the decision table.  the second algorithm programsa mixed entry decision table directly without going throughthe intermediate step of conversion to a limited entry form, therebyresulting in storage economy.  a comparison of the algorithms and others proposed in the literature is made.  some features of a decision tableto fortran iv translator for the ibm  developed by the authors are given.cacm june, muthukrishnan, c. r.rajaraman, v..kdecision tables, diagnostic aids, system analysis, business applications.c. . . . .ca jb february ,   : pm
