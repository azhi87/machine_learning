a vector space model for automatic indexing.win a document retrieval, or other pattern matchingenvironment where stored entities (documents) are compared with each other or with incoming patterns(search requests), it appears that the best indexing (property) space is one where each entity lies as far awayfrom the others as possible; in these circumstances the value of an indexing system may be expressibleas a function of the density of the object space; in particular, retrieval performance may correlate inverselywith space density.  an approach based on space density computations is used to choose an optimumindexing vocabulary for a collection of documents.  typical evaluation results are shown, demonstratingthe usefulness of the model.cacm november, salton, g.wong, a.yang, c. s..kautomatic information retrieval, automaticindexing, content analysis, document space.c. . . .ca jb january ,   : am
