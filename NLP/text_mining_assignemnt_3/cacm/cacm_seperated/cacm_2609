interpolation with rounded ramp functions.wa new interpolation function is introduced. it has infinitely many continuous derivatives and is a composition of ramp functions with smoothed bendscalled rounded ramp functions.  how the interpolation function can be extended to more than one variable isshown.  an efficient fortran program is given by which the interpolation function can be obtained for a given point set.cacm august, lagerlof, r. o. e..kinterpolation, approximation, smooth interpolation,multi variable interpolation, interpolation function, approximation function, spline-like function.c.ca jb january ,   : am
