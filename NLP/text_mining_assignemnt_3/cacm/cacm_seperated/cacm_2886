semantic evaluation from left to right.wthis paper describes attribute grammars and theiruse for the definition of programming languages and compilers; a formal definition of attribute grammarsand a discussion of some of its important aspects are included. the paper concentrates on the evaluationof semantic attributes in a few passes from left to right over the derivation tree of a program.  acondition for an attribute grammar is given which assures that the semantics of any program can be evaluatedin a single pass over the derivation tree, and an algorithm is discussed which decides how manypasses from left to right are in general necessary, given the attribute grammar. these notions are explainedin terms of an example grammar which describes the scope rules of algol .  practical questions, suchas the relative efficiency of different evaluation schemes, and the ease of adapting the attribute grammarof a given programming language to the left-to-right evaluation scheme are discussed.cacm february, bochmann, g. v..kattribute grammars, semantics of programming languages,semantic attributes, left-to-right parsing, multipass compilers, semantic evaluation, semantic conditions.c. . . .ca jb january ,   : am
