   grad assistant - a program for symbolic algebraic manipulation and differentiation.w   the general recursive algebra and differentiation assistant (grad assistant)now under development is a set of lisp functions which symbolically manipulateabd differentiate algebraic expressions. it is designed for use with problemms in which a large amount of routine manipulation is to be done by a program without human intervention. thus, grad must recognize necessary simplificationswithout external guidance. while some complicated expressions (notably onesinvolving nested radicals and trigonometric functions) do not yield completelyto the present version, it has proved quite useful indeed.cacm august, fletcher, j. g.ca es march ,  : am
