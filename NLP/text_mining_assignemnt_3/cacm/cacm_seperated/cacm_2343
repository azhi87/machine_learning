a proposal to establish a pseudo virtual memory via writable overlays.wmany computer systems solve executable storagesize problems for large programs by using overlays.  however, it appears that no one overlay scheme containsa well-balanced combination of the most useful capabilities which are found in various existing techniques. a proposal is presented which utilizes several of the best capabilities from existing schemesand is complemented by several additional features, e.g. writable overlays.  the writable overlay capabilityprovides a virtual memory effect, although the programmer may still be required to design the overlayconfiguration.  since overlay structuring is a complex task, several tools (including a graphic display)are included in the proposal in order to aid the programmer in the design.  the content of overlaysis briefly discussed, and it is noted that many of the details of the final overlay configuration may be decided after the fact.cacm june, spacek, t. r..koverlay, overlay structure, segment, segmentation,folding, paging, linkage editor, collector, loader, virtual memory.c. . . .ca jb january ,   : am
