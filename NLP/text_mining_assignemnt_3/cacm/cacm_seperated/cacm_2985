effects of chargeout on user/manager attitudes.wthe relationship of in ternal pricing systemsfor computer services (chargeout systems) and user management attitudes about their computer-basedinformation systems is investigated. evidence is provided that the relationship conforms to a generalpattern that would be expected from the hypothesis of the four stages of edp growth [].  the results alsoindicate that the chargeout systems characteristic of advanced edp stage environments are associated withrelatively high levels of positive user attitudes and marked increases in edp training for users. both factorsare important to the user/manager involvement necessary for effective control of computer-based systems. development and main tenance of computer-based systems is asserted to be a category of organizationalchange.  a "felt need" for the change on the part of the user/manager is prerequisite to any change takingplace.  the research methods of behavioral science are applied to investigate the user/managerenvironment and the effects of chargeout.cacm march, nolan, r. l..kcomputer management, computer budget,chargeout, stage hypothesis, control.c. . .ca jb december ,   : am
