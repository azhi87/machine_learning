a programming system for the on-line analysis of biomedical images.wa preliminary description of the software for a computer-displaysystem is given with special emphasis on the  man-machine interaction. this system is intended for a wide variety of biomedical applications.as an example, the methods are applied to the karyotyping of chromosomes.  the system is separated into four programming tasks: picture transformations, file maintenance, picture structuring, and display management.  picture structuringis considered as the vehicle for man-machine communication.a prototype data format for pictures, called a picture-form, is developed.structure operators are defined which manipulate picture-forms to produce new pictures-forms.  many of the ideas are taken from the symbolic mathematical laboratory at mit conceived by marvin minsky.cacm may, hodes, l..kimage processing, biomedical image processing, on-line image processing,semiautomatic image processing, data structure, structure operators,picture processing, biomedical picture processing, on-line pictureprocessing, semiautomatic picture processing, semiautomatickaryotyping, karyotyping, list processing picture processing.c. . . . .ca jb february ,   : pm
