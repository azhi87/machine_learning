wengert's numerical method for partial derivatives,orbit determination and quasilinearization.win a recent article in the communicationsof the acm, r. wengert suggested a technique for machine evaluation of the partial derivatives of a functiongiven in analytical form.  in solving non-linear boundary-value problems using quasilinearization manypartial derivatives must be formed analytically and then evaluated numerically.  wengert's method appearsvery attractive from the programming viewpoint equations which might not otherwise be undertaken.cacm april, bellman, r. e.kagiwada, h.kalaba, r. e.ca jb march ,   : pm
