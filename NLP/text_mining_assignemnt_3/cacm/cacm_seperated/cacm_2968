a comparison of tree-balancing algorithms.wseveral algorithms-height-balance (i.e. avland extensions), weight-balance (i.e. bb and wb), and total restructuring-for building balanced binary searchtrees are compared.  the criteria for comparison encompass theoretical aspects (e.g. path lengths) and implementationindependent and machine/algorithm-dependent measures (e.g. run time).  a detailed analysis of code isalso presented at a level believed to be language-and compiler-independent.  the quality of the resultingtrees and the overhead spent on building them are analyzed, and some guidelines are given for an efficientuse of the methods.  if insertion and subsequent queries are the only operations of in terest, then "pure"avl trees present the overall best qualities.cacm may, baer, j. l.schwab, b..kbinary search trees, avl trees, weight-balanced trees,path length, analysis of algorithms, information storage and retrieval.c. . . .ca jb december ,   : am
