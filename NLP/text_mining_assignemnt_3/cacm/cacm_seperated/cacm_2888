information reference coding.witems in business systems have to be identifiedby reference codes, which can later be used as data codes and file keys in an associated data processingsystem.  in business systems associated with large collections of integrated files (database)it is vital to assign codes in a methodical way so as to control future extension and changes while maintainingcorrect program action. the principles of methodical coding are discussed, and the way inwhich logical connections between data items must be reflected in the reference code framework is shownthrough a set-theoretic information model.cacm january, florentin, j. j..kdata, file, reference code, systemsanalysis, information modeling, database.c.ca jb january ,   : am
