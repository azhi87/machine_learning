reasoning about arrays.wa variety of concepts, laws, and notations are presented which facilitatereasoning about arrays.  the basic concepts include intervals and theirpartitions, functional restriction, images, pointwise extension of relations,ordering, single-point variation of functions, various equivalence relations for array values, and concatenation.  the effectivenessof these ideas is illustrated by informal descriptions ofalgorithms for binary search and merging, and by a short formal proof.cacm may, reynolds, j.c..karrays, assertions, program proving, intervals, partitions, pointwiseextension, ordering, concatenation, binary search, merging.c. . . .ca dh june ,   : pm
