   symbolic manipulation of poisson series.w   poisson series of three variables are manageable symbolically through as a set of formal subroutines written partially in the ibm  machine language,but to be called in the fortran language for use in fortran  programs. an effort has been made to supply those operations which are most required bycelestial mechanics. the routines are entirely self-contained subroutinesand require only standard fortran input/output units  and ; they are designto avoid waste and overflow of core storage space.cacm august, danby, j.deprit, a.rom, a.ca es march ,  : am
