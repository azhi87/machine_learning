the distribution of a program in primary and fast buffer storage.wa virtual memory computer system with a fastbuffer (cache) memory between primary memory and the central processing unit is considered.  the optimaldistribution of a program between the buffer and primary memory is studied using the program's lifetimefunction.  expressions for the distribution of a program which maximizes the useful fraction ofthe cost-time integral of primary and fast buffer storage are obtained for swapping and nonswapping buffer management policies.cacm july gelenbe, e..kcache, virtual memory, lifetime function, cost-time integral, fast buffer.c. . .ca jb january ,   : pm
