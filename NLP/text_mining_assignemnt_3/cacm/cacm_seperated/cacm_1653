system performance evaluation: survey and appraisal.wthe state of the art of system performanceevaluation is reviewed and evaluation goals and problems are examined.  throughput, turnaround, andavailability are defined as fundamental measures of performance; overhead and cpu speed are placed inperspective.  the appropriateness of instruction mixes, kernels, simulators, and other tools is discussed,as well as pitfalls which may be encountered when using them.  analysis, simulation, and synthesis arepresented as three levels of approach to evaluation, requiring successively greater amounts of information. the central role of measurement in performance evaluation and in the development of evaluation methods is explored.cacm january, calingaert, p.ca jb march ,   : am
