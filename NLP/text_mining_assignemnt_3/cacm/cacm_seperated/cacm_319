on a class of iteration formulas and some historical notes.wthe class of iteration formulas obtainableby rational approximations of "euler's formula" is derived with the corresponding error estimates. some historical notes on iterative procedures are followed by a derivation of euler's formula with theassociated error estimate in a new notation which simplifies the error estimate and suggests generalizations. the final section considers the pade approximants to the "euler polynomial" and shows how a number of knownformulas may be derived from this unified approach.  there is a short discussion of the "best" formula.cacm june, traub, j. f.ca jb march ,   : pm
