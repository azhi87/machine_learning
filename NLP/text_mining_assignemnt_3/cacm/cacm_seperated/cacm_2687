a cell organized raster display for line drawings.wraster scan computer graphics displays with"real time" character generators have previously been limited to alphanumeric characters.  a display isdescribed which extends the capabilities of this organization to include general graphics.  the feasibilityof such a display is shown by deriving the minimum number of patterns required in the read onlymemory of the character generator to synthesize an arbitrary line.  the synthesis process does not compromisepicture quality since the resulting dot patterns are identical with those of a conventionalraster display.  furthermore, the time constraints of a raster display are shown to be satisfied fora typical design for very complex line drawings.cacm february, jordan, b. w. jr.barrett, r. c..kgraphics, raster display, line drawing, discreteimage, dot generation, matrix displays.c. . .ca jb january ,   : pm
