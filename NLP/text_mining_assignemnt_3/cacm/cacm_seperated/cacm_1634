 bits are not enough for -digit accuracy.wfrom the inequality ^ < ^, we are likelyto conclude that we can represent -digit decimal floating-point numbers accurately by -bit floating-pointnumbers.  however, we need  significant bits to represent some -digit numbers accurately. in general, we can show that if ^p < ^q-, then q significant bits are always enough for p-digit decimalaccuracy.  finally, we can define a compact -bit floating-point representation that will give significant bits, for numbers of practical importance.cacm february, goldberg, i. b.ca jb february ,   : pm
