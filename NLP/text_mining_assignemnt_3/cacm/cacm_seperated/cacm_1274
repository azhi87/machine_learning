on the numerical solution of an n-point boundaryvalue problem for linear ordinary differential equations.wa method for the numerical solution of then-pointboundary value problem for homogeneous linear ordinary differential equations is developed.  themethod requires two runge-kutta integrations over the interval under consideration and the solution ofa linear system of equations with n- unknowns.cacm april, day, j. t.ca jb march ,   : pm
