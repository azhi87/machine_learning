models for parallel processing within programs:application to cpu:i/o and i/o:i/o overlap.wapproximate queueing models for internal parallelprocessing by individual programs in a multiprogrammed system are developed in this paper.  the solution techniqueis developed by network decomposition.  the models are formulated in terms of cpu:i/o and i/o:i/o overlapand applied to the analysis of these problems.  the percentage performance improvement from cpu:i/ooverlap is found to be greatest for systems which are in approximate cpu:i/o utilization balance and forlow degrees of multiprogramming.  the percentage improvement from i/o:i/o overlap is found to be greatestfor systemtems in which the i/o system is more utilized than the cpu.cacm october, towsley, d.chandy, k.m.browne, j.c..kmultiprogramming, parallel processing, queueingnetwork models, multiprocessing of computation and i/o .c. .ca dh january ,   : pm
