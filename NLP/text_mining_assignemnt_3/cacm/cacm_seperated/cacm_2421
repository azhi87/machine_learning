a scan conversion algorithm with reduced storage requirements.wmost graphics systems using a raster scan outputdevice (crt or hardcopy) maintain a display file in the xy or random scan format.  scan converters,hardware or software, must be provided to translate the picture description from the xy format to the rasterformat.  published scan conversion algorithms which are fast will reserve a buffer area large enoughto accommodate the entire screen.  on the other hand, those which use a small buffer area are slow becausethey require multiple passes through the xy display file.  the scan conversion algorithm describedhere uses a linked list data structure to process the lines of the drawing in strips corresponding togroups of scan lines.  a relatively small primary memory buffer area is used to accumulate the binary imagefor a group of scan lines.  when this portion of the drawing has been plotted, the buffer is reused forthe next portion.  because of the list processing procedures used, only a single pass through the xy displayfile is required when generating the binary image and only a slight increase in execution time overthe fully buffered core results.  results slow that storage requirements can be reduced by more than percent while causing less than a  percent increase in execution time.cacm november, jordan, b. w. jr.barrett, r. c..kgraphics, scan conversion, raster plotter,line drawing, discrete image, dot generation.c. . .ca jb january ,   : am
