analyses of deterministic parsing algorithms.wthis paper describes an approach for determiningthe minimum, maximum, and average times to parse sentences acceptable by a deterministic parser. these quantities are presented in the form of symbolic formulas, called time-formulas.  the variablesin these formulas represent not only the length of the input string but also the time to perform elementaryoperations such as pushing, popping, subscripting, iterating, etc.  by binding to the  variables actual numericalvalues corresponding to a given compiler-machine configuration, one can determine the execution timefor that configuration.  time-formulas are derived by examining the grammar rules and the program representingthe algorithm one wishes to analyze.  the approach is described by using a specific grammar that definessimple arithmetic expressions.  two deterministicparsers are analyzed: a top-down recursive descentll() parser, and a bottom-up slr() parser.  the paper provides estimates for the relative efficienciesof the two parsers.  the estimates applicable to a specific machine, the pdp-, are presented andsubstantiated buy benchmarks.  finally, the paper illustrates the proposed approach by applying it tothe analyses of parsers for a simple programming language.  cacm june, cohen, j.roth, m.s..ksyntactic analysis, analysis of algorithms,top-downand bottom-up parsing, relative efficiencies..c. . . . .ca dh february ,   : pm
