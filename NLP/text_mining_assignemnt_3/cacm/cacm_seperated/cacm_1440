starting approximations for square root calculation on ibm system/.wseveral starting approximations for squareroot calculation by newton's method are presented in a form to facilitate their use in ibm system/ squareroot routines.  these approximations include several for the range [/, ], which is the intervalof primary interest on ibm system/.cacm april, fike, c. t.ca jb march ,   : am
