description of basic algorithm in detab/ preprocessor.wthe basic algorithm for the conversion of decisiontables into cobol code is contained in thegenerator portion of the detab/ preprocessor.  thegenerator analyzes a decision table and produces simple cobol conditional statements.  core storage issaved by using queueing techniques and extensive indexing and also by outputting the code as it is generated,a line at a time.  the only optimization attempted is the elimination of obviously unnecessarytests on certain conditions in the decision table.  since the preprocessor and this language associated withit were developed for cobol users, the preprocessor was written in a modular form in required cobol-.cacm july, callahan, m. d.chapman, a. e.ca jb february ,   : am
