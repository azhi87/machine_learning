shallow binding in lisp ..wshallow binding is a scheme which allows thevalue of a variable to be accessed in a bounded amount of computation.  an elegant model for shallow bindingin  lisp . is presented in which context-switching is an environment tree transformation called rerooting. rerooting is completely general and reversible, and is optional in the sense that a lisp . interpreterwill operate correctly whether or not rerooting is invoked one very context change.   since rerootingleaves assoc [v, a] invariant, for all variables v and all environments a, the programmer can have accessto a rerooting primitive, shallow[], which gives him dynamic control over whether accesses are shallow ordeep, and which affects only the speed of execution of a program, not its semantics.  in addition, multipleprocesses can be active in the same environment structure, so long as rerooting is an indivisible operation. finally, the concept of rerooting is shown to combine the concept of shallow binding in lisp withdijkstra's display for algol and hence is a general model for shallow binding.cacm july, baker, h.g. jr..klisp ., environment trees, funarg's, shallow binding,deep binding, multiprogramming, algol display.c. . .ca dh february ,   : pm
