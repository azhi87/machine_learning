a fast string searching algorithm.wan algorithm is presented that searches forthe location, "i," of the first occurrence of a character string, "pat," in another string, "string." during the search operation, the characters of pat are matched starting with the last character ofpat.  the information gained by starting the match at the end of the pattern often allows the algorithmto proceed in large jumps through the text being searched.  thus the algorithm has the unusual property that,in most cases, not all of the first i characters of string are inspected.  the number of characters actuallyinspected (on the average) decreases as a function of the length of pat.  for a random englishpattern of length , the algorithm will typically inspect i/ characters of string before finding a match ati.  furthermore, the algorithm has been implemented so that (on the average) fewer than i+patlen machineinstructions are executed.  these conclusions are supported with empirical evidence and a theoreticalanalysis of the average behavior of the algorithm.  the worst case behavior of the algorithm is linear ini+patlen, assuming the availability of array space for tables linear in patlen plus the size of the alphabet.cacm october, boyer, r. s..kbibliographic search, computational complexity,information retrieval, linear time bound, pattern matching, text editing.c. . .ca jb december ,   : am
