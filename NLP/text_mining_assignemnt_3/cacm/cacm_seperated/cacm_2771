the synthesis of solids bounded by many faces.wa technique is presented which allows a classof solid objects to be synthesized and stored using a computer.  synthesis begins with primitive solidslike a cube, wedge, or cylinder.  any solid can be moved, scaled, or rotated.  solids may also beadded together or subtracted.  two algorithms to perform addition are described.  for practical designers,the technique has the advantage that operations are concise, readily composed, and are given in termsof easily imagined solids.quite short sequences of operations suffice to build up complex solids bounded by many faces.cacm april, braid, i. c..kcomputational geometry, computer-aided design,graphics, machined components, polyhedra, shape synthesis, three-dimensional modeling.c. .ca jb january ,   : pm
