determining the minimum-area encasingrectangle for an arbitrary closed curve.wthis paper describes a method for finding therectangle of minimum area in which a given arbitrary plane curve can be contained.  the method is of interestin certain packing and optimum layout problems.  it consists of first determining the minimal-perimeterconvex polygon that encloses the given curve and then selecting the rectangle of minimum area capableof containing this polygon.  three theorems are introduced to show that one side of the minimum-arearectangle must be colinear with an edge of the enclosed polygon and that the minimum-area encasing rectanglefor the convex polygon is also the minimum-area rectangle for the curve.cacm july, freeman, h.shapira, r..kenclosed curve, optimum layout, optimumpacking, minimum-area encasing rectangle.c. .ca jb january ,   : am
