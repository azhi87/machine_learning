an anomaly in space-time characteristics ofcertain programs running in a paging machine.wthe running time of programs in a paging machinegenerally increases as the store in which programs are constrained to run decreases.  experiments,however, have revealed cases in which the reverse is true: a decrease in the size of the store is accompaniedby a decrease in running time.  an informal discussion of the anomalous behavior is given, and forthe case of the fifo replacement algorithm a formal treatment is presented.cacm june, belady, l. a.nelson, r. a.shedler, g. s..kpaging machines, demand paging, replacement algorithm.c.ca jb february ,   : am
