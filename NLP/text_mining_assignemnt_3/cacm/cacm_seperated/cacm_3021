a method for obtaining digital signatures and public-key cryptosystems.wan encryption method is presented with the novelproperty that publicly revealing an encryption key does not thereby reveal the corresponding decryptionkey.  this has two important consequences: () couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmitkeys, since a message can be enciphered using an encryption key publicly revealed by the intended recipient. only he can decipher the message, since only he knows the corresponding decryption key.  ()a message can be "signed" using a privately held decryption key.  anyone can verify this signature usingthe corresponding publicly revealed encryption key.  signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannotlater deny the validity of his signature.  this has obvious applications in "electronic mail" and "electronicfunds transfer" systems.  a message is encrypted by representing it as a number m, raisingm to a publicly specified power e, and then taking the remainder when the result is divided by the publiclyspecified product, n, of two large secret prime numbers p and q.  decryption is similar;only a different,secret, power d is used, where e * d =  (mod(p-) * (q-)).  the security of the system rests in part onthe difficulty of factoring the published divisor, n.cacm february, rivest, r.l.shamir, a.adleman, l..kdigital signatures, public-key cryptosystems,privacy, authentication, security, factorization, prime number, electronic mail, message-passing,electronic funds transfer, cryptography..c. . . . .ca jb march ,   : pm
