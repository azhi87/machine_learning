combining decision rules in a decision table.wthe techniques for minimizing logic circuitsare applied to the simplification of decision tables by the combining of decision rules. this methodis logically equivalent to the quien-mccluskey method for finding prime implicants.  if some of thedecision rules implied in the else rule occur with low frequency, then the else rule can be used to furthersimplify the decision table.  several objectives merit consideration in optimizing a decision table:()reducing machine execution time; () reducing preprocessing time; () reducing required machine memory;() reducing the number of decision rules.  (this often improves the clarity of the decision tableto a human reader.)  it will be shown that objectives () and () can be furthered with the above methods. objective () is also attained if overspecified decision rules are not combined.  objective () must becompared against the potential benefits of objectives (), (), and () in deciding whether to use the above methods.cacm august, shwayder, k..kthe quine-mccluskey method, prime implicants, minimization,maximization, logic circuit, boolean method, coding, decision tables, flowcharting, sorting.c. . . . .ca jb january ,   : pm
