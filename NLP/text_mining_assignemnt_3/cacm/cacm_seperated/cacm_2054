on the feasibility of voice input toan on-line computer processing system.wan on-line digital computer processing system is considered in which an ordinary telephone is the complete terminal device, input to the computer being provided as a sequence of spoken words, and output to the user being audio responses from the machine.  the feasibility of implementing such a system with a fortran-like algebraic compiler as the object processor is considered.  details of a specific word recognition program are given.  this technique depends on three simplifying restrictions, namely, a "small"vocabulary set, "known" speakers, and a "moment of silence"between each input word.  experimental results are presented givingerror rates for different experimental conditions as well as the machine resources required to accommodate several users at a time. the results show that at this time it is both economically and logically feasible to handle at least  users at a time with an ibm / computer.cacm june, elder, h. a..kspeech recognition, word recognition, pattern-matching, patternrecognition, time-sharing, remote access, voice input, speech input,telephone input/output, acoustic signal, spoken-word input, talking to computers, man-machine interaction.c. . . . .ca jb february ,   : pm
