implementing clenshaw-curtis quadrature,ii computing the cosine transformation.win a companion paper to this, "i methodologyand experiences," the automatic clenshaw-curtis quadrature scheme was described and how each quadratureformula used in the scheme requires a cosine transformation of the integrand values was shown. the high cost of these cosine transformations has been a serious drawback in using clenshaw-curtis quadrature. two other problems related to the cosine transformation have also been trouble some.  first, theconventional computation of the cosine transformation by recurrence relation is numerically unstable, particularlyat the low frequencies which have the largest effect upon the integral.  second, in case the automaticscheme should require refinement of the sampling, storage is required to save the integrand values afterthe cosine transformation is computed.  this second part of the paper shows how the cosine transformation canbe computed by a modification of the fast fourier transform and all three problems overcome.  the modificationis also applicable in other circumstances requiring cosine or sine transformations, such as polynomialinterpolation through the chebyshev points.cacm may, gentleman, w. m..kfast fourier transformation, cosine transformation,clenshaw-curtis quadrature, chebyshev series.c. . .ca jb january ,   : am
