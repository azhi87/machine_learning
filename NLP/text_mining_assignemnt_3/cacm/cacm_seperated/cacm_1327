use of decision tables in computer programming.wa decision table is a tabular form for displayingdecision logic.  decision tables have many inherent advantages.  the technique to be illustratedputs these advantages to use in that it enables one to program directly from a decision table.  the techniqueis based on the creation of a binary image of a limited entry decision table in computer memory. a binary image of a given set of input conditions can also be created.  this data image is used to scanthe decision table image to arrive at the proper course of action.  there are several advantages gainedfrom the programming point view: () amount of computer memory used is drastically reduced, () programmingis simplified, and () documentation is brief and clear.cacm january, kirk, h. w.ca jb march ,   : pm
