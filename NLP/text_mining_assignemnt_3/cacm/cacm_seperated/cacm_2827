a parametric algorithm for drawing picturesof solid objects composed of quadric surfaces.wan algorithm for drawing pictures of three-dimensionalobjects, with surfaces made up of patches of quadric surfaces, is described.  the emphasis ofthis algorithm is on calculating the intersections of quadric surfaces. a parameterization scheme is used. each quadric surface intersection curve (qsic) is represented as a set of coefficients and parameterlimits.  each value of the parameter represents at most two points, and these may easily be distinguished. this scheme can find the coordinates of points of even quartic (fourth-order) intersection curves, usingequations of no more than second order.  methods of parameterization for each type of osic are discussed,as well as surface bounding and hidden surface removal.cacm october, levin, j..kcomputer graphics, hidden surface removal,quadric surface intersection curves.c. . . . .ca jb january ,   : pm
