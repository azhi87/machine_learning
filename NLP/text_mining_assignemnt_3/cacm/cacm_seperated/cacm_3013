some new methods of detecting step edges in digital pictures.wthis note describes two operators that respondto step edges, but not to ramps.  the first is similar to the digital laplacian, but uses the max, ratherthan the sum, of the x and y second differences.  the second uses the difference between the mean andmedian gray levels in a neighborhood.  the outputs obtained from these operators applied to a set of testpictures are compared with each other and with the standard digital laplacian and gradient.  a thirdoperator, which uses the distance between the center and centroid of a neighborhood as an edge value, is alsobriefly considered; it turns out to be equivalent to one of the standard digital approximations to the gradient.cacm february,schachter, b.j.rosenfeld, a..kimage processing, pattern recognition, edge detection.c.ca jb march ,   : pm
