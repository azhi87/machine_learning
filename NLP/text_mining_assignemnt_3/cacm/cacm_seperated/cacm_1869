block structures, indirect addressing, and garbage collection.wprogramming languages have included explicitor implicit block structures to provide a naming convenience for the programmer.  however, when indirectaddressing is used, as in snobol, naming constraints may be introduced.  two modifications to snobol are described,resulting in two desirable consequences: () naming constraints disappear even when there isindirect addressing within function definitions; and () there is a significant saving in the number ofcalls to the garbage collector, because some garbage is collected, at little expense, each time a functionreturns to its calling program.  these modifications have been implemented as an extension to a snobol dialect.cacm july, kain, r. y..kblock structures, indirect addressing,garbage collection, local names, snobol.c.ca jb february ,   : pm
