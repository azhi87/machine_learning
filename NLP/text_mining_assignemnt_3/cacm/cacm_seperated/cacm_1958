improving round-off in runge-kutta computations with gill's method.wa runge-kutta-gill scheme in common use is based on an incompleteadaptation for floating point operations of gill's method.  animproved version reduces round-off error significantly.  in this notethe heart of the scheme is presented in fortran language.  it isthen shown how an improved version of the method can be obtained withthe addition of two fortran statements.  the two version is asignificant improvement.  a numerical example comparing the two is included.cacm december, thompson, r. j..krunge-kutta methods, ordinary differentialequations, round-off error, error analysis.c. .ca jb february ,   : pm
