peekabit, computer offspring of punchedcard peekaboo, for natural language searching.wthe "peekaboo" idea from punched card informationretrieval methods has been mated with the idea of superimposed punching to produce a programmingtechnique which cuts computer run time in half on a test search of , subject index entries.  a searchprogram using the device has been operational since late .  as an item is entered in the store,an -byte mask is created from the item's meaningful words using the inclusive or operation.  if, at searchtime, the logical product (using the and operation) of this mask and a similarly constructed question maskis not equal to the question mask, then one or more question words are not present in the store item. an equality is in conclusive; the words of the store item must be unpacked and compared with questionwords.  the present store is made up of over , subject index entries estimated to average  characterseach.  longer texts, such as abstracts, could be handled by multiple masks.cacm september,hutton, f. c..kpeekaboo, superimposed coding, natural languagesearching text searching, information compaction, computer search technique.c.ca jb february ,   : am
