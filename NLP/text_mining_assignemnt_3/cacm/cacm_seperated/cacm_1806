on the downhill method.wthe downhill method is a numerical method forsolving complex equations f(z) =  on which the only restriction is that the function w = f(z) mustbe analytical.  an introduction to this method is given and a critical review of relating literature ispresented.  although in theory the method always converges, it is shown that a fundamental dilemma existswhich may cause a breakdown in practical applications.  to avoid this difficulty and to improve the rate ofconvergence toward a root, some modifications of the original method are proposed and a program (fortran)based on the modified method is given in algorithm .  some numerical examples are included.cacm december, bach, h..kdownhill method, complex relaxation method, complexiteration, complex equation, transcendental complex equation, algebraic complex equation.c.ca jb february ,   : pm
