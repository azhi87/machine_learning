pitch period determination of speech sounds.wa computer procedure which determines pitchperiods by the recognition of the peak structure of the speech waveform is described.  speech sounds weresampled by a microphone and an analog-to-digital converter attached to an interconnected ibm -pdp-system.  these utterances were recorded at the normal noise level of the computer room but were notband-compressed or phase-distorted in any manner.  a sequence of operations defined on the speech wave selectsa list of points along the waveform as candidates for pitch markers.  these markers are validated byan error detection and correction procedure.about  percent of the pitch periods were recognized correctlywithin  to  times real-time on the ibm .cacm june,reddy, d. r.ca jb february ,   : am
