file organization: the consecutive retrieval property.wthe consecutive retrieval property is an importantrelation between a query set and record set.  its existence enables the design of an informationretrieval system with a minimal search time and no redundant storage.  some important theorems onthe consecutive retrieval property are proved in this paper.  conditions under which the consecutive retrievalproperty exists and remain invariant have been established.  an outline for designing an informationretrieval system based on the consecutive retrieval property is also discussed.cacm september, ghosh, s. p..kfile organization, consecutive storage, consecutiveretrieval, information retrieval, record organization, query structure, record structure, storage ontapes, storage space, minimum access time.c. . .ca jb january ,  : pm
