programming decision tables in fortran, cobol or algol.wa simple broad-based approach for programmingdecision tables in fortran or cobol is developed and presented.  with inputs in standard form, as definedin the paper, the programming of any decision table can be done with one or two fortran statements,or with two cobol statements, if the compute verb is available in the cobol processor.  it is  shownthat the method is applicable even when there are more than two mutually exclusive states of one, two ormore table conditions.  it is further shown that multi-state conditions in decision tables can oftensimplify the programming.  the method outlined has the further advantage that all possible combinationsof conditions are considered.  it is shown that the suggested procedure is easily implemented in algol.cacm january, veinott, c. g.ca jb march ,   : pm
