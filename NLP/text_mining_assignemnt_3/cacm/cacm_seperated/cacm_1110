a fourier series method for the numerical solutionof a class of parabolic partial differential equations*.wa fourier series method is described which, whenapplied to a certain class of parabolic partial differential equations, reduces the problem to a systemof ordinary differential equations.  an application is given for which the method shows a considerable advantageover conventional finite difference methods.cacm march, forrington, c. v. d.ca jb march ,   : am
