execution characteristics of programs in a page-on-demand system.wdata are presented which show the execution characteristicsof two types of commonly used programs in a large-scale, time-shared computer system.  a softwaremonitoring facility built into the supervisor was used for data collection during normal system operation. these data were analyzed, and results of this analysis are presented for a fortran compilerand an interactive line file editor.  probability distribution functions and other data are given forsuch things as cpu intervals, i/o intervals, and the number of such intervals during execution.  empiricaldistributions are compared with simple theoretical distributions (exponential, hyperexponential, and geometric). other data show paging characteristics of tasks as a function of the number of pages those tasks have in core.cacm april, boyse, j. w..kprogram behavior, virtual memory, paging, demand paging,software monitor, program execution characteristics, compiler execution behavior, editor execution behavior.c. . . . . .ca jb january ,   : am
