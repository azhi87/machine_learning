an analysis of some time-sharing techniques.wthe effectiveness of certain time-sharing techniquessuch as program, relocation, disk rotational delay minimization, and swap volume minimization isinvestigated.  summary data is presented, and the findings are discussed.  the vehicle for this investigationwas a simula based simulation model reflecting an early framework for a planned burroughs b time-sharingsystem.  inasmuch as the b system is based upon the use of variable sized segments and adynamic overlay procedure, data is also presented which provides some indication of the effectiveness of thistype of organization in a time-sharing environment.  the design characteristics and operational capabilitiesof the simulation model are also described.cacm february, nielsen, n. r..kb, bulk core usage, operating system model, relocation,rotational delay minimization, simulation, swap volume minimization, system simulation, time-sharing.c. .ca jb february ,   : am
