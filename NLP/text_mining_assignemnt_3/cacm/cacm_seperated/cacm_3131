focus microcomputer number system.wfocus is a number system and supporting computationalalgorithms especially useful for microcomputer control and othersignal processing applications.  focus has the wide-rangingcharacter of floating-point numbers with a uniformity of state distributionsthat give focus better than a twofold accuracy advantageover an equal word length floating-point system.  focus computationsare typically five times faster than single precision fixed-pointor integer arithmetic for a mixture of operations, comparable inspeed with hardware arithmetic for many applications.  algorithmsfor -bit and -bit implementations of focus are included.cacm march, edgar, a.d.lee, s.c..knumber representation, logarithmic arithmetic, computationalspeed, computational accuracy, microcomputer applications  .c. . . . .ca dh april ,   : am
