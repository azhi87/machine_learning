recent improvements in madcap.wmadcap is a programming language admitting subscripts,superscripts and certain forms of displayed formulas.  the basic implementation of this language wasdescribed in a previous paper [madcap: a scientific compiler for a displayed formula textbook language, comm.acm  (jan. ), -].  this paper discusses recent improvements in the language in three areas: complexdisplay, logical control, and subprogramming.  in the area of complex display, the most prominent improvementsare a notation for integration and for the binomial coefficients.  in the area of logical controlthe chief new feature is a notation for variably nested looping.  the discussion of subprogramming is focusedon madcap's notation for and use of "procedures."cacm november, wells, m. b.ca jb march ,   : pm
