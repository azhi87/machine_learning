power trees.wthe new class of pk trees is presented, whereheight balance is maintained for the nodes iying on particular paths.  the number of nodes of a pk treeasymptotically grows as a power of the height, in the worst case.  a procedure for node insertion is given,and the class of trees  considered is restricted to ipk trees, which are buildable by such a procedure. the average behavior of such trees, studied by an extensive set of simulation runs, is close to thatof avl trees.  in particular, the family of ipo trees whose main advantage is the reduced number ofrestructurings required after node insertion, is analyzed.cacm november, luccio, f.pagli, l..kbinary search trees, pk trees, ipk trees, searchlength, node insertion, subtree rotation.c. . . . .ca dh january ,   : pm
