on the near-optimality of the shortest-latency-time-firstdrum scheduling discipline.wfor computer systems in which it is practicalto determine the instantaneous drum position, a popular discipline for determining the sequence in whichthe records are to be accessed is the so-called shortest-latency-time-first, sltf, discipline.  whena collection of varying-length records is to be accessed from specified drum positions, it is known thatthe sltf discipline does not necessarily minimize the drum latency time.  however, we show that the totaltime to access the entire collection for any sltf schedule is never as much as a drum revolutionlonger than a minimum latency schedule.cacm june, stone, h. s.fuller, s.  h..kdrum scheduling, shortest-access-time-first, minimallatency scheduling, shortest-latency-time-first.c. . .ca jb january ,   : pm
