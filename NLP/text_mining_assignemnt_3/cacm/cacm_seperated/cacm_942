fortran subroutines for time series analysis.wthe authors have recently been concerned in atime-series study that constituted a fairly typical piece of applied statistical research, involving extensivecomputations on a moderately large quantity of data.  wehave found that the many different numericalprocesses that were required could be built up almost completely from a small number of basic operations,and a set of fortran subroutines has been written to perform these.  the main purpose of thisnote is to describe these subroutines, but since the question of general statistical programs istopical [], we include some general remarks.cacm january, healy, m. j. r.bogert, b. p.ca jb march ,   : pm
