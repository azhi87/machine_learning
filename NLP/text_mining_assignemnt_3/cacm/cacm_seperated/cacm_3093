automatic error recovery for lr parsers.win this paper we present a scheme for detectingand recovering from syntax errors in programs.  the scheme, which is based on lr parsing, is drivenby information which is directly and automatically obtainable from the information that is already presentin an lr parser.  the approach, which is patterned after that of levy and graham and rhodes, appears toprovide error recovery which is both simple and powerful.cacm june, mickunas, m.d.modry, j.a..kprogramming languages, error correction, automaticcorrection, parsing, lr, syntax errors, compilers.c. . .ca dh february ,   : pm
