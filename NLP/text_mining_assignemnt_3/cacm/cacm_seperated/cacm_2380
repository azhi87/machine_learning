tenex, a paged time sharing system for the pdp-.wtenex is a new time sharing system implementedon dec pdp- augmented by special paging hardware developed at bbn.  this report specifies a set of goalswhich are important for any time sharing system.  it describes how the tenex design and implementationachieve these goals.  these include specifications for a powerful multiprocess large memory virtual machine,intimate terminal interaction, comprehensive uniform file and i/o capabilities, and clean flexiblesystem structure.  although the implementation described here required some compromise to achieve asystem operational within six months of hardware checkout, tenex has met its major goals and providedreliable service at several sites and through the arpa network.cacm march, bobrow, d. g.burchfiel, j. d.murphy, d. l.tomlinson, r. s.beranek, b..ktenex, paging, virtual machines, time sharingsystem, scheduling algorithm, process structure, pdp-.c. . . .ca jb january ,   : pm
