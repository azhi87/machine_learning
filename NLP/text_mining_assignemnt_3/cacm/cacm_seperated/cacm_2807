on the stability of gauss-jordan elimination with pivoting.wthe stability of the gauss-jordan algorithmwith partial pivoting for the solution of general systems of linear equations is commonly regarded as suspect. it is shown that in many respects suspicions are unfounded, and in general the absolute error in the solutionis strictly comparable with that corresponding to gaussian elimination with partial pivoting plus backsubstitution.  however, when a is ill conditioned, the residual corresponding to the gauss-jordan solutionwill often be much greater than that corresponding to the gaussian elimination solution.cacm january, peters, g.wilkinson, j. h..kgauss-jordan algorithm, gaussian elimination, back-substitution,backward error analysis, bounds for error in solution, bound for residual .c. .ca jb january ,   : am
