automatic data structure choice in a language of very high level.wsetl is a set-theoretically oriented languageof very high level whose repertoire of semantic objects includes finite sets, ordered n-tuples, andsets of ordered n-tuples usable as mappings.  this paper describes the structure of an optimizer for thislanguage.  among other methods of interest, the optimizer uses techniques which allow relations of inclusionand membership to be established, the domains and ranges of (tabulated) mappings to be estimated fromabove and below, and the single-valuedness of (tabulated) mappings to be proved.  once facts of thiskind have been established, automatic choice of data structures becomes possible. the methods employedare based upon, and extend, known techniques of data flow analysis.cacm december, schwartz, j. t..kprogram optimization, automatic programming, high-levellanguages, set-theoretic languages, data structure choice.c. . .ca jb january ,   : pm
