optimal reorganization of distributed space disk files.win most database organizations, the cost of accessingthe database will increase due to structural changes caused by updates and insertions.  by reorganizingthe database,the access costs can be reduced.  a basic problem is to establish the proper tradeoff betweenperformance, storage costs, and reorganization costs.  this paper considers the optimum points at whichto reorganize a database.  a disk file organization which allows for distributed free space is described. a cost function describing the excess costs due to physical disorganization is defined, and this functionis minimized to obtain the optimum reorganization points.  numerical examples based on the characteristicsof existing disk storage devices are given.cacm november, maruyama, k.smith, s. e..kdisk file, free space,retrieval, insertion, deterioration, reorganization.c. .ca jb january ,   : pm
