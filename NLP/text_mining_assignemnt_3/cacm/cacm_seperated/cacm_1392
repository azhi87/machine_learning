experience with formac algorithm design.wvarious facets of the design and implementationof mathematical expression manipulation algorithms are discussed.  concrete examples are provided by theformac expand and differentiation algorithms, a basic formac utility routine, and an experiment in theextraction of the skeletal structure of an expression.  one recurrent theme is the need to avoid excessiveintermediate expression swell in order to minimize core storage requirements. although many details fromthe formac implementation are presented, an attempt is made to stress principles and ideas of general relevancein the design of algorithms for manipulating mathematical expressions.cacm august, tobey, r. g.ca jb march ,   : pm
