key-to-address transform techniques: a fundamentalperformance study on large existing formatted files.wthe results of a study of eight differentkey-to-address transformation methods applied to a set of existing files are presented.  as each methodis applied to a particular file, load factor and bucket size are varied over a wide range.  in addition,appropriate variables pertinent only to a specific method take on different values.  the performance ofeach method is summarized in terms of the number of accesses required to get to a record and the numberof overflow records created by a transformation.  peculiarities of each method are discussed.  practicalguidelines obtained from the results are stated.  finally, a proposal for further quantitative fundamental study is outlined.cacm april, lum, v. y.yuen, p. s. t.dodd, m..khashing, hashing techniques, hashing methods, hashcoding, keys, key transformation, key-to-address transformation, direct addressing, direct access method,randomizing, random access,file addressing, file organizations, file structures, scatter storage,search, collisions, clusters, information retrieval.c. . . . . .ca jb february ,   : pm
