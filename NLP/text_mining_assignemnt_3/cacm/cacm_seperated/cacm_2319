operating system performance.wan overview of the current and future positionswith respect to operating system performance is given.  while a great deal of information and a largenumber of models for subsystems have been developed, gaps still exist in out knowledge.  because of thesevere interactions between the various subsystems of an operating system, an overall model of the totalsystem must be developed to be able to analyze and design the performance aspects of an operating systemalthough such total system designs are exceptional today, it is projected that they will become increasinglymore common and necessary in the near future.  such a design philosophy will clearly have a severe impacton the way we go about modularizing operating and computer systems.cacm july, lynch, w. c..kcomputer system, operating system, performanceevaluation, performance measurement, measurement, techniques, modularity, layering, structured programming,paging, virtual memory, input/output, disk storage facility, drum storage facility, sector queueing.c. .ca jb january ,   : pm
