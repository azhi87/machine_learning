synchronization with eventcounts and sequencers.wsynchronization of concurrent processes requires controlling the relative ordering of events in the processes.a new synchronization mechanism is proposed, using abstract objects called eventcounts and sequencers, that allows processesto control the ordering of events directly, rather than using mutualexclusion to protect manipulations of shared variables that controlordering of events.  direct control of ordering seems to simplifycorrectness arguments and also simplifies implementation in distributedsystems.  the mechanism is defined formally, and then severalexamples of its use are given.  the relationship of the mechanismto protection mechanisms in the system is explained; in particular,eventcounts are shown to be applicable to situations where confinementof information matters.  an implementation of eventcounts and sequencers in a system with shared memory is described.cacm february, reed, d.p.kanodia, r.k..kprocess synchronization, interprocess communication, distributedsystems, security models, mutual exclusion, semaphores.c. .ca dh april ,   : am
