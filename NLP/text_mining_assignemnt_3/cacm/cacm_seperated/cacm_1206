the self-judgment method of curve fitting.wa computer-oriented method for processing andcommunicating numerical data is described.  the instrument reliability factors (irf), which exactlydefine the limits of reliability of each measured item of information, are used to compute the maximumpermitted error (mpe) associated with each values of each ordinate.  the self-judgment principle (sjp)is used to discard wrong information and to compute mean values of the parameters and their mpe's in termsof the irf.  data compatibility tests with any number of different equations can be made quickly. otherwise intractable problems are easily solved, and the design of many experiments is greatly simplified. the computational and mathematical techniques used to reduce bias in the sjp are discussed.  inadequaciesin the statistical and graphical methods of curve fitting are noted.cacm august, demaine, p. a. d.ca jb march ,   : pm
