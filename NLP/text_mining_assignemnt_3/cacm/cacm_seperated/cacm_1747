three criteria for designing computing systems to facilitate debugging.wthe designer of a computing system should adoptexplicit criteria for accepting or rejecting proposed system features.  three possible criteria of thiskind are input recordability, input specifiability, and asynchronous reproducibility of output.  these criteriaimply that a user can, if he desires, either know or control all the influences affecting the contentand extent of his computer's output.  to define the scope of the criteria, the notion of an abstractmachine of a programming language and the notion of a virtual computer are explained.  examples of applicationsof the criteria concern the reading of a time-of-day clock,  the synchronization of parallelprocesses, protection in multiprogrammed systems, and the assignment of capability indexes.cacm may, van horn, e. c..kcomputer design, computer design criteria, computersystems, computer systems design, input equipment, input equipment design, operating systems, operatingsystems design, multiprogramming, multiprogrammed systems, multiprogrammed system design, virtual computers,programming languages, programming language design, program semantics, programming language semantics,determinism, reproducibility, repeatability, deterministic computers, protection, memory protection,information security, information privacy, computing reliability, debugging, program debugging, program testing,parallel processing, parallel programming, multiprocessing.c. . . . . . . . . .ca jb february ,   : am
