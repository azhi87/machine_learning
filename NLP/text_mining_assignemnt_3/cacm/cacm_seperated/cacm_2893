computers as an innovation in american local governments.wcomputers and electronic data processing area major technological innovation in the operations of american local government. this paper establishes thatthere is substantial variation among the larger local governments in the rate at which they adopt computertechnology, in the level of financial support they provide for edp, and in the extensiveness and sophisticationof their automated applications.  the central question addressed is: what might explain thedifferences between governments in the extent to which they adopt and use computers?  hypotheses aretested for several streams of explanatory factors, using data from more than  city and county governments. the findings identify certain local government milieus which are particularly conducive to higher levelsof computer innovation.  somewhat unexpected findings reveal the significant impact of the distributionof control over edp decisions and the dominant political values within the government. other importantfactors include the measured need for computer applications and the presence of external funding supportfor computing.  finally, the paper suggests a framework for identifying the key determinantsof other technological innovations.cacm december, danziger, j. n.dutton, w. h..kinnovation, technological innovation, computer utilization,computer adoption, american local government, city government computers, county government computers..c. . . .ca jb december ,   : pm
