multiprocessor memory organization and memory interference.wthe structure of shared memory in a multiprocessorcomputer system is examined with particular attention to nonin terleaved memory.  alternative memoryorganizations are compared and it is shown that a home memory organization, in which each processoris associated with one or more memories in which its address space is concentrated, is quite effective inreducing memory in terference.  home memory organization is shown to be particularly suited to certain specializedcomputation problems as well as to possess advantages in terms of in terference and reliability forgeneral purpose computation.  results for in terleaved memory are drawn from previous work and are used forcomparison.  trace-driven simulations are used to verify the conclusions of the analysis.cacm october, smith, a. j..kmemory in terference, interleaving, multiprocessing,trace-driven simulation, queueing theory, shared memory.c. . .ca jb december ,   : am
