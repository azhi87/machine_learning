quasilinearization and the calculation of eigenvalues.wseveral eigenvalue problems for systems ofordinary differential equations are considered.  they are resolved computationally using the quasilinerizationtechnique, a quadratically convergent successive approximation scheme related tothe newton-raphson-kantorovich method.cacm july, bellman, r., kagiwada, h.kalaba, r.ca jb march ,   : pm
