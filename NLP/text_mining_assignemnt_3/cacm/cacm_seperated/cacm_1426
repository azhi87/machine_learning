a simulation of hospital admission policy.wa study is described which simulates differentadmission policies of a large specialized hospital.  the objective is to determine better policies forstabilization of admission and census rates while maintaining a reasonably full hospital.  there types ofpolicies were examined: admission based on percentages of discharge rates, discharge rates plus or minus aconstant, and fixed authorizations independent of discharge rates.  the last type policy produced more stablesimulated results, and when put into practice, improvements were realized.cacm may, smith, w. g.solomon jr., m. b.ca jb march ,   : am
