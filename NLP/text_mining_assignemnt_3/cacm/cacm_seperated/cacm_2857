referencing lists by an edge.wan edge reference into a list structure is a pairof pointers to adjacent nodes.  such a reference often requires little additional space, but its use canyield efficient algorithms. for instance, a circular link between the ends of a list is redundant if the listis always referenced by that edge, and list traversal is easier when that link is null.  edge references alsoallow threading of nonrecursive lists, can replace some header cells, and enhance the famousexclusive-or-trick to double-link listscacm june, wise, d. s..klist processing, circular, doubly linked, overlappingsublist, header cell, pointer, cursor.c. . .ca jb january ,   : pm
