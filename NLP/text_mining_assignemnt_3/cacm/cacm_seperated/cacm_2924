an interactive computer graphics approach to surface representation.wan in teractive computer graphics method has beendeveloped for the rapid generation of arbitrary shaped three-dimensional surfaces.  the method is a synthesisof spline theory and algorithms, an in teractive means for man-machine communication, and software forstatic or dynamic graphics display.  the basic technique employed is a modified lofting method onwhich sectional curves are represented by uniform b-splines and the surface is in terpolated between sectionsby cardinal splines.  among the features of this method are algorithms which enable in teractivemodification of the b-spline representation of the sectional curves.  at all stages of the process, thespatial information is graphically displayed to the user.  complex surfaces can be created by the combinationof a number of shapes that have been separately generated and automatically joined.  the system has beensuccessfully in terfaced to a variety of analytical routines for structural, medical and graphical applications.cacm october, wu, sheng-chuanabel, j. f.greenberg, d. p..kcomputer graphics, three-dimensional surface representation,splines, lofting,finite element input methods.c. . . . .ca jb december ,   : am
