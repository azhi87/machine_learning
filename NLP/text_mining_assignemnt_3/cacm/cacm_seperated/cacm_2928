hardware estimation of a process' primary memory requirements.wa minor hardware extension to the honeywell processor is demonstrated to allow the primary memory requirements of a process in multics to be approximated. the additional hardware required for this estimate to be computed consists of a program accessibleregister containing the miss rate of the associative memory used for page table words.  thisprimary memory requirement estimate was employed in an experimental version of multics to control thelevel of multiprogramming in the system and to bill for memory usage.  the resulting system's tuning parametersdisplay configuration insensitivity, andit is conjectured that the system would also track shiftsin the referencing characteristics of its workload and keep the system in tune.cacm september, giffor, d. k..kprimary memory requirement, virtual memory, levelof multiprogramming, associative memory, working set, resource allocation, lru stack model, referencing characteristics.c. . . .ca jb december ,   : pm
