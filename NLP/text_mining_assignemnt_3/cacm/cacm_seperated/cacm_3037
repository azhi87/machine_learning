a linear sieve algorithm for finding prime numbers.wa new algorithm is presented for finding allprimes between  and n.  the algorithm executes in time proportional to n (assuming that multiplicationof integers not larger than n can be performed in unit time).  the method has the same arithmetic complexityas the algorithm presented by mairson []; however, our version is perhaps simpler and more elegant. it is also easily extended to find the prime factorization of all integers between  and n in time proportional to n.   cacm december, gries, d.misra, j..kprimes, algorithms, data structures.c. . .ca dh january ,   : am
