empirical evaluation of some featuresof instruction set processor architectures.wthis paper presents methods for empirical evaluationof features of instruction set processors (isps).  isp features are evaluated in terms of the timeused or saved by having or not having the feature.  the methods are based on analysis of traces of programexecutions.  the concept of a register life is in troduced, and used to answer questions like: how manyregisters are used simultaneously? how many would be sufficient all of the time? most of the time? whatwould the overhead be if the number of registers were reduced? what are registers used for during theirlives? the paper also discusses the problem of detecting desirable but non-existing instructions. otherproblems are briefly discussed.  experimental results are presented, obtained by analyzing programs running on the dec system  isp.cacm march, lunde, a..kcomputer architecture, program behavior, instructionsets, op code utilization, register structures, register utilization, simultaneous registerlives, instruction tracing, execution time.c. . .ca jb december ,   : am
