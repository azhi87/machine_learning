generation of test matrices by similarity transformations.wa method for obtaining test matrices witha prescribed distribution of characteristic roots is given.  the process consists of using particularlysimple similarity transformations to generate full matrices from canonical forms.  the matrices generatedalso have known characteristic vectors, inverses and determinants.cacm june, ortega, j. m.ca jb march ,   : pm
