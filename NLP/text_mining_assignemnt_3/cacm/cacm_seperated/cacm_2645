two languages for estimating program efficiency.wtwo languages enabling their users to estimatethe efficiency of computer programs are presented.  the program whose efficiency one wishes to estimate is writtenin the first language, a go-to-less programming language which includes most of the features of algol.  the second language consists of interactive commands enabling its users to provide additional informationabout the program written in the first language and to output results estimating its efficiency. processors for the two languages are also described.  the first processor is a syntax-directedtranslator which compiles a program into a symbolic formula representing the execution time for that program. the sound processor is a set of procedures for that program.  the second processor is a set ofprocedures for algebraic manipulation which can be called by the user to operate on the formula producedby the first processor.  examples of the usage of the two languages are included.  the limitations ofthe present system, its relation to knuth's work on the analysis of algorithms, and some of the directionsfor further research are also discussed.cacm june, ccohen, j.zuckerman, c..kprogramming languages, syntax-directed translation,symbolic manipulation, program efficiency, analysis of algorithms.c. . . .ca jb january ,   : pm
