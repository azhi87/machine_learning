buddy systems.wtwo algorithms are presented for implementingany of a class of buddy systems for dynamic storage allocation.  each buddy system corresponds to a set ofrecurrence relations which relate the block sizes provided to each other. analyses of the in ternal fragmentationof the binary buddy system, the fibonacci buddy system, and the weighted buddy system are given.comparative simulation results are also presented for in ternal, external, and total fragmentation.cacm june, peterson, j. l.norman, t. a..kdynamic storage allocation, buddy system, fragmentation,fibonacci buddy system, weighted buddy system.c. . .ca jb december ,   : pm
