optimal program and data locations in computer networks.wan optimization procedure for the allocationof program and data files in a computer network is presented.  this algorithm takes into account thedependencies between files and programs such as occur in real heterogeneous computer networks.  insightsinto whether or not to convert programs from one computer to another can also be gained from themodel.  a search procedure for the file location problem is described, along with an exampleand a possible application of the model.cacm may, morgan, h. l.levin, k. d..kcomputer networks, databases, distributeddatabases, optimal file location.c. . .ca jb december ,   : am
