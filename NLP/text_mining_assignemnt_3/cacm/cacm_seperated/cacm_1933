coding the lehmer pseudo-random number generator.wan algorithm and coding technique is presentedfor quick evaluation of the lehmer pseudo-random number generator modulo ** - , a prime mersennenumber with produces ** -  numbers, on a p-bit (greater than ) computer.  the computation method isextendible to limited problems in modular arithmetic.  prime factorization for ** -  and a primitive rootfor ** - , the next largest prime mersenne number, are given for possible construction of a pseudo-randomnumber generator of increased cycle length.cacm february, payne, w. h.rabung, j. r.bogyo, t. p..kpseudo-random number, random number, modular arithmetic,uniform probability density, uniform frequency function, simulation, prime factorization, primitive rootsca jb february ,   : am
