polyphase sorting with overlapped rewind*.wa variation of the polyphase merge techniqueof sorting is described which permits one tape at a time to be rewound while the merge is continued onthe remaining tapes.  the result is the overlapping of a major portion of the rewind time.  the techniqueshould be considered whenever a sort is written to operate on five or more tapes that cannot be read backwards. the savings of the overlap method appear to increase as the number of available tapes is increased.cacm march, mcalester, r. l.ca jb march ,   : am
