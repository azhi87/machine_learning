note on triple-precision floating-point arithmetic with -bit numbers.win a recent paper, gregory and raney describeda technique for double-precision floating-point arithmetic.  a similar technique can be developed fortriple-precision floating-point arithmetic and it is  the purpose of this note to describe this technique. only the multiplication and the division algorithms are described, since the addition-subtractionalgorithm can be obtained by a trivial modification of the algorithm in gregory's and raney's paper.cacm march, ikebe, y.ca jb march ,   : pm
