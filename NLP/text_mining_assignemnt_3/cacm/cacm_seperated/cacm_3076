value conflicts and social choice in electronicfunds transfer system developments.wduring the last few years, computer-basedsystems which automate the transfer and recording of debits and credits have begun to be implemented ona large scale.  these systems promise both financial benefits for the institutions that use them and potentialconveniences to their customers.  however, they also raise significant social, legal, and technicalquestions that must be resolved if full scale systems for electronic funds transfer (eft) are notto cause more problems for the larger public than they solve.  this paper examines the incentives for eftdevelopments and the social problems they raise in the context of conflicts between five different valuepositions that are often implicit in analyses of proposed eft arrangements.  these conflicts reflectthe relative importance of certain problems for specific groups.  the value positions implicit in eft proposalshelp to organize analyses of market arrangements, system reliability, and privacy of transactions.  thesetopics are analyzed in this article and related to the value positions held by concerned parties.  last,the ways in which the public can learn about the social qualities of different eft arrangements andthe pace of eft developments are both discussed in the context of social choice. cacm august, kling, r..kelectronic funds transfer systems, social impactsof computing, privacy, social choice, computer networks, network reliability, security, social values.c. . . . . .ca dh february ,   : pm
