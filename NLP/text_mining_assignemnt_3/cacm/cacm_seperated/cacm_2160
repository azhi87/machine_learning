canonical structure in attribute based file organization.wa new file structure for attribute based retrievalis proposed in this paper.  it allows queries involving arbitrary boolean functions of the attribute-valuepairs to be processed without taking intersections of lists.  the structure is highly dependent on theway in which the file is to be used and is uniquely determined by the specification of the allowed queries. thus, for example, the structure for retrieval on the basis of ranges of values of a given attribute wouldbe very different from one where only retrieval on the basis of a single value is permitted.  the fileorganization being proposed is based on the atoms of a boolean algebra generated by the queries.  the desirableproperties claimed for this structure are proved, and file maintenance questions are discussed.cacm september, wong, e.chiang, t. c..kaddress calculation, atoms of boolean algebra,attributes, boolean functions, boolean queries, file organization, information retrieval, invertedfile, key words, multilist, queries, searches .c. . .ca jb february ,   : pm
