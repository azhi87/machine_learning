creation and control of internal data basesunder a fortran programming environment.wa method is described for the definition of a user's common structureand the automatic generation of the necessary common, dimension, equivalence,and type declarations for each of the user's routines.  the definitionfor the common is contained in an easy to modify form, thusallowing the control of general communications of data between routines.the described system has been implemented on the ibm ,cdc  series, and the ibm .  the method has proved to be invaluablefor the definition and control of common in many large-scale programs.cacm april, desalvio, a. j.purdy, j. g.rau, j..kdata base, fortran, common, common equivalencing,subroutine communication, data communication.c. . .ca jb february ,   : pm
