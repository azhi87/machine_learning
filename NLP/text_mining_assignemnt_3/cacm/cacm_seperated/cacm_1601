parallel numerical methods for the solution of equations.wclassical iterative procedures for the numericalsolution of equations provide at each stage a single new approximation to the root in question.  atechnique is given for the development of numerical procedures which provide, at each stage, several approximationsto a solution of an equation.  the several approximations obtained in any iteration are computationallyindependent, making the methods of interest in a parallel processing environment.  convergence isinsured by extracting the "best information" at each iteration.  several families of numerical procedureswhich use the technique of the procedures in a parallel processing environment are developed and measurementsof these statistics are reported.  these measurements are interpreted in a parallel processingenvironment.  in such an environment the procedures obtained are superior to standard algorithms.cacm may, shedler, g. s.ca jb february ,   : am
