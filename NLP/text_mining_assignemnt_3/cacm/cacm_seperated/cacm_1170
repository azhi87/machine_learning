analyzing english syntax with a pattern-learning parser.wa dependency analysis system based on patternrecognition and learning logic was developed to infer word classes and rules of syntactic combinationfrom experience with text which had been analyzed.  the characteristics used to form word classes are thedepth in the dependency tree of each word, the direction of its governor and the same features foreach of its immediate neighbors. syntactic rules of combination show the relation of a word to its governorin the depth pattern of the sentence.  the system was tested on  elementary basic english sentencesincluding  used earlier by knowlton in a different learning parser of all  sentences.  afterexperience with  sentences it was able to generalize with  percent accuracy to the next . in accumulative learning trials after the first  sentences it averaged a probability of . for accuratelyparsing each new sentence it encountered.  it was concluded that the system is adequate for learningto parse the bulk of basic english but that further development is required before conclusions aboutits application to ordinary english can be stored.  the system is operational and available onthe arpa/sdc time-shared computing system.cacm november, mcconlogue, k.simmons, r. f.ca jb march ,   : pm
