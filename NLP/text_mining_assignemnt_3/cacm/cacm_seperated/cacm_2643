the minimization of spatially-multiplexed character sets.wthe paper describes a technique for compactingcharacter sets in a digital computer while retaining fast access to individual bits.  it considers the problemof minimizing the storage needed to contain such tables.  reduction techniques are developed, andthe problem is shown to reduce to a covering problem.cacm june, gimpel, j. f..kparsing, lexical analysis,scanning,string processing, spatial multiplexing.c.ca jb january ,   : pm
