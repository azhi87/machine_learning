computers in group theory: a survey.wcomputers are being applied to an increasinglydiverse range of problems in group theory.  the most important areas of application at present arecoset enumeration, subgroup lattices, automorphism groups of finite groups, character tables, and commutatorcalculus.  group theory programs range from simple combinatorial or numerical programs to largesymbol manipulation systems.  in this survey the more important algorithms in use are described and contrasted,and results which have been obtained using existing programs are indicated.  an extensive bibliography is included.cacm january, cannon, j. j..kgroup theory, coset enumeration, subgroup lattices,automorphism groups, character tables, commutator calculus, topology, crystallography, permutation groups,abelian groups, discrete mathematics, non-numerical programming, symbol manipulation, survey.c. . .ca jb february ,   : pm
