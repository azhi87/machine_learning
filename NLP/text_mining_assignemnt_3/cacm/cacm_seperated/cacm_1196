applications of differential equations in general problem solving.wa large class of problems leading to digitalcomputer processing can be formulated in terms of the numerical solution of systems of ordinary differentialequations.  powerful methods are in existence for the solution of such systems.  a good general purposeroutine for the solution of such systems furnishes a powerful tool for processing many problems.  this istrue from the point of view of ease of programming, ease of debugging, and minimization of computer time. a number of examples are discussed in detail.cacm september, klopfenstein, r. w.ca jb march ,   : pm
