a selective traversal algorithm for binary search trees.wthe problem of selecting data items froma binary search tree according to a list of range conditions is considered.  the process of visiting aminimal number of nodes to retrieve data satisfying the range conditions is called selective traversal.  presentedin this paper is an algorithm for selective traversal which uses a tag field for each node in thetree.  the algorithm is particularly useful and efficient when examination of data is more timeconsuming than examination of a tag field. cacm june, driscoll, j.r.lien, y.e..kdata retrieval, range conditions, binary searchtree, tree traversal, selective traversal.c. . .ca dh february ,   : pm
