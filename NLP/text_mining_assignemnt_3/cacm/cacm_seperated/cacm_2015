a technique for generating almost optimalfloyd-evans productions for precedence grammars.wa technique is developed for generating almost optimal floyd-evans productions given a precedence grammar. a graph formulation is used for the problem of merging productions.  the productions generated correspond to the minimum cost inverse-arborescence of that graph.  the validity of the technique isdemonstrated for weak precedence grammars defined here, but the productionsmechanically generated for any precedence grammar can often be modified in such a way that correct, almost optimal parsers are obtained.cacm august, ichbiah, j. d.morse, s. p..ktranslator writing systems, syntactic analysis, floyd-evansproductions, precedence grammars, translator optimization,merger algorithm, minimum cost inverse-arborescence, graph theory.c. . .ca jb february , : pm
