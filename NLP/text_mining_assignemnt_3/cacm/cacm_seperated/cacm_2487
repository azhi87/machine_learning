cubic spline solutions to fourth-order boundary value problems.wthe cubic spline approximation to the fourth-orderdifferential equation y''''+p(x)y''+q(x)y'+r(x)y=t(x) is shown to reduce to the solution of a five-term recurrencerelationship.  for some special cases the approximation is shown to be simply related to a finitedifference representation with a local truncation error of order (y/)delta^.cacm june, hoskins, w. d..kcubic spline, differential equations, boundary value problem.c. .ca jb january ,   : pm
