pm, a system for polynomial manipulation.wpm is an ibm  program system for formal manipulationof polynomials in any number of variables, with integral coefficients unrestricted in size.  someof the formal operations which can be performed by the system are sums, differences, products, quotients,derivatives, substitutions and greater common divisors.  pm is based on the refco iii list processingsystem, which is described and compared with the lisp and slip systems.  the pm subroutines for arithmeticof large integers are described as constituting an independently useful subsystem.  pm is compared withthe alpak system in several respects, including the choice of canonical forms for polynomials.  a newalgorithm for polynomial greatest common divisor calculation is mentioned, and exaples areincluded to illustrate its superiority.cacm august, collins, g. e.ca jb march ,   : pm
