an experimental model of system/.wthe problem of predicting the performance ofmodern computer systems is formidable.  one general technique which can ease this problem is macroscopic simulation. this paper reports on the applicability of that technique to system/.  the paper describesan experimental model of system/-its hardware, software, and its environment.  the measures of system performanceproduced by the model consist of statistics relating to turnaround time, throughput, hardware utilization,software utilization, and queueing processes.  the model is mechanized in simscript and consists ofsome  statements.  an auxiliary programs, the job generator, creates automatically the propertiesof system/ jobs that get simulated.cacm november, katz, j. h.ca jb february ,  : pm
