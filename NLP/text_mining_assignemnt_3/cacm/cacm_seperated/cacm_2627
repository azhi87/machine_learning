scheduling independent tasks to reduce mean finishing time.wsequencing to minimize mean finishing time(or mean time in system) is not only desirable to the user, but it also tends to minimize at each pointin time the storage required to hold incomplete tasks.  in this paper a deterministic model of independenttasks is introduced and new results are derived which extend and generalize the algorithms known forminimizing mean finishing time.  in addition to presenting and analyzing new algorithms it is shownthat the most general mean-finishing-time problem for independent tasks is polynomial complete, and hence unlikelyto admit of a non-enumerative solutioncacm july, bruno, j.coffman, e. g. jr.sethi, r..kminimizing mean finishing time, minimizing mean flowtime, sequencing algorithms, optimal scheduling algorithms, deterministic scheduling models.c. .ca jb january ,   : pm
