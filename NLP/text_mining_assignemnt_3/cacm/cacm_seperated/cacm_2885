on self-organizing sequential search heuristics.wthis paper examines a class of heuristics formaintaining a sequential list in approximately optimal order with respect to the average time requiredto search for a specified element, assuming that each element is searched for with a fixed probabilityindependent of previous searches performed.  the "move to front" and "transposition" heuristics are shownto be optimal to within a constant factor, and the transposition rule is shown to be the more efficientof the two. empirical evidence suggests that transposition is in fact optimal for any distribution of search probabilities.cacm february, rivest, r..ksearching, self-organizing, list-processing, heuristics.c. .ca jb january ,   : am
