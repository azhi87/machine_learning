variable-precision exponentiation.wa previous paper presented an efficient algorithm,called the recomputation algorithm, for evaluating a rational expression to within any desired toleranceon a computer which performs variable-precision arithmetic operations.  the recomputation algorithm can beapplied to expressions involving any variable-precision operations having o(^(-p) + sum{|ei|}) error bounds,where p denotes the operation's precision and ei denotes the error in the operation's ith argument. this paper presents an efficient variable-precision exponential operation with an error bound of the aboveorder.  other operations such as log, sin, and cos, which have simple series expansions, can be handled similarly.cacm january, richman, p. l..kvariable-precision, exponential function,error analysis, interval arithmetic.c.ca jb january ,   : pm
