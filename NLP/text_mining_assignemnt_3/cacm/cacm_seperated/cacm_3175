breaking substitution ciphers using a relaxation algorithm.wsubstitution ciphers are codes in which each letterof the alphabet has one fixed substitute, and the word divisions do not change.  in this paper the problem of breaking substitutionciphers is represented as a probabilistic labeling problem.every code letter is assigned probabilities of representing plain textletters.  these probabilities are updated in parallel for allcode letters, using joint letter probabilities.  iterating the updatingscheme results in improved estimates that finally lead tobreaking the cipher.  the method is applies successfully to two examples.cacm november, peleg, s.rosenfeld, a..kcryptography, substitution ciphers,probabilistic classification, relaxation.c. .ca db january ,   : am
