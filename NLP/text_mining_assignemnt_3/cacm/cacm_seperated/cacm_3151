an optimal real-time algorithm for planar convex hulls.wan algorithm is described for the construction in real-time of theconvex hull of a set of n points in the plane.   using an appropriate datastructure, the algorithm constructs the convex hull by successiveupdates, each taking time o(log n), thereby achieving a totalprocessing time o(n log n).  cacm july, preparata, f.p..kcomputational geometry, convex hull, planar set ofpoints, real-time algorithms, on-line algorithms.  .c. . .ca dh august ,   : pm
