perturbations of eigenvalues of non-normal matrices.wthe problem considered is to give bounds for finiteperturbations of simple and multiple eigenvalues of nonnormal matrices, where these bounds are in termsof the eigenvalues, the departure from normality, and the frobenius norm of the perturbation matrix, butnot in terms of the eigen system.  the bounds which are derived are shown to be almost attainable for any set of matrices. cacm january, van der sluis, a..kperturbation of eigenvalues, non-normal matrices,departure from normality, gershgorin circles.c.ca jb january ,   : am
