a preliminary system for the design of dbtg data structures.wthe functional approach to database design isintroduced.  in this approach the goal of design is to derive a data structure which is capable of supportinga set of anticipated queries rather than a structure which "models the business" in some otherway. an operational computer program is described which utilizers the functional approach to design datastructures conforming to the data base task group specifications.  the automatic programming technologyutilized by this program, although typically used to generate procedure, is here used to generate declaratives.cacm october, gerritsen, r..knetwork model of databases, data base task group, databasedesign, data structure, automatic programming, translation, nonprocedural languages.c. . . . .ca jb january ,   : pm
