automated algebraic manipulation in celestial mechanics.win this paper we consider some of the applicationsof automated algebraic manipulation which have been made in celestial mechanics.  particular attentionis paid to the use of poisson series, and a typical problem in perturbation theory is described. the requirements of processors for use in celestial mechanics are considered and compared with those for generalmanipulation packages.  some future directions for research using these systems are briefly outlined. to illustrate the relative simplicity of the algorithm required in celestial mechanics, a typicalintegration problem is considered in an appendix. cacm august, jefferys, w. h..kseries manipulation, automated algebra, celestial mechanics.c. . .ca jb february ,   : pm
