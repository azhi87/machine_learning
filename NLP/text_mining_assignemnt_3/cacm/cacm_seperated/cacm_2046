a relational model of data for large shared data banks.wfuture users of large data banks must be protected from having to know how the data is organized in the machine (the internal representation).  a promptingservice which supplies such information is not a satisfactorysolution.  activities of users at terminals and most applicationprograms should remain unaffected when the internal representationof data is changed and even when some aspects of the external representation are changed.  change in data representation will often be needed as a result of changes in query, update, and report traffic and natural growth in the types of stored information.  existing noninferential, formatted data systems provide users with tree-structured files or slightly more general network models of the data.  in section , inadequacies of these models are discussed.a model based on n-ary relations, a normal form for data base relations,and the concept of a universal form for data base relations,and the concept of a universal data sublanguage are introduced.  insection , certain operations on relations (other than logicalinference) are discussed and applied to the problemsof redundancy and consistency in the user's model.cacm june, codd, e. f..kdata bank, data base, data structure, data organization,hierarchies of data, networks of data, relations, derivability, redundancy, consistency, composition, join, retrievallanguage, predicate calculus, security, data integrity.c. . . . . .ca jb february ,   : am
