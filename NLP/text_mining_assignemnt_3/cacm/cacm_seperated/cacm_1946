computing polynomial resultants: bezout's determinantvs. collins' reduced p.r.s. algorithm.walgorithms for computing the resultant of twopolynomials in several variables, a key repetitive step of computation in solving systems of polynomialequations by elimination, are studied.  determining the best algorithm for computer implementation dependsupon the extent to which extraneous factors are introduced, the extent of propagation of errors caused bytruncation of real coefficients, memory requirements, and computing speed.  preliminary considerations narrowthe choice of the best algorithm to bezout's determinant and collins' reduced polynomial remainder sequence(p.r.s.) algorithm.  detailed tests performed on sample problems conclusively show that bezout's determinantis superior in all respects except for univariate polynomials, in which case collins' reducedp.r.s. algorithm is somewhat faster.  in particular bezout's determinant proves to be strikingly superior innumerical accuracy, displaying excellent stability with regard to round-off errors. results of tests are reported in detail.cacm january, ku, s. y.adler, r. j..kresultant algorithm, g.c.d. algorithm, polynomialresultant, elimination, bezout's determinant, sylvester's determinant, reduced p.r.s. algorithm, euclideanalgorithm, multivariate polynomial equations.c. . . .ca jb february ,   : pm
