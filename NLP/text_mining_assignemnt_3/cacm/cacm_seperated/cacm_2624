formal requirements for virtualizable third generation architectures.wvirtual machine systems have been implementedon a limited number of third generation computer systems, e.g. cp- on the ibm /.  from previousempirical studies, it is known that certain third generation computer systems, e.g. the dec pdp-, cannotsupport a virtual machine system.  in this paper, model of a third-generation-like computer system isdeveloped.  formal techniques are used to derive precise sufficient conditions to test whether suchan architecture can support virtual machines.cacm july, popek, g. j.goldberg, r. p..koperating system, third generation architecture,sensitive instruction, formal requirements, abstract model, proof, virtual machine, virtual memory,hypervisor, virtual machine monitor.c. . . .ca jb january ,   : am
