automatic error bounds for simple zeros of analytic functions.wthe cauchy-ostrowski theorem on convergenceof newton iterates for an analytic function in one variable is extended to include computational errorsusing complex interval arithmetic. several numerical examples are given for polynomials with real and complexroots and one example for the bessel function of the first kind.cacm february, rokne, j..kreal intervals, complex intervals, real intervalarithmetic, complex interval arithmetic, newton's method, cauchy-ostrowski theorem, zeros ofpolynomials, zeros of bessel functions.c. . .ca jb january ,   : pm
