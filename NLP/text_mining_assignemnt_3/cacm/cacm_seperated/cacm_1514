on the expected gain from adjust ing matched term retrieval systems.wa file adjustment procedure based on maximizingthe bayes expected gain proposed for matched term retrieval systems.  the expected gain and its probabilitydistribution are derived as a function of: () the prior proportion of omitted terms, and () thecoefficient of separation between two distributions corresponding to values of an adjustment statistic.  anexample evaluates the gain parameters for a typical information retrieval system.cacm november, shumway, r. h.ca jb february ,   : pm
