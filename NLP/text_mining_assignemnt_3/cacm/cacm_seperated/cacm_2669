a simple linear model of demand paging performance.wpredicting the performance of a proposed automaticallymanaged multilevel memory system requires a model of the patterns by which programs refer to theinformation stored in the memory.  some recent experimental measurements on the multics virtual memorysuggest that, for rough approximations, a remarkably simple program reference model will suffice.  the simplemodel combines the effect of the information reference pattern with the effect of the automatic managementalgorithm to produce a single, composite statement: the mean number of memory references betweenpaging exceptions increases linearly with the size of the paging memory.  the resulting model is easyto manipulate, and is applicable to such diverse problems as choosing an optimum size for a paging memory,arranging for reproducible memory usage charges, and estimating the amount of core memory sharing.cacm april, saltzer, j. h..kpaging, demand paging, memory models, program models,performance measurement, multilevel memory systems, virtual memory, associative memory, memory usage accounting, multics.c. . .ca jb january ,   : am
