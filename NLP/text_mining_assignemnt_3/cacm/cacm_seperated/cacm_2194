how to keep the addresses short.wan algorithm is presented for minimizing thesum of the lengths of the blocks of coding produced by an assembler or compiler when () the length ofeach computer instruction is assumed to be either "long" or "short" ("long," if the memory location addressedis more than a predetermined distance from the current location; "short," otherwise), and ()there are blocks of instructions whose beginnings (origins) are separated by prespecified amounts. for example,some computers permit either -bit addressing (interpreted relative to the location counter) or full-bit addressing of all of memory.  when assembling or compiling two or more blocks of instructions whichhave many mutual references in such a computer, there is no simple iterative procedure for keepingas many of the addresses short as possible.  this paper demonstrates that a wide class of problems ofthis type can be formulated as covering problems solvable by means of elementary arithmetic operationson the column vectors of a ternary matrix.cacm may, richards, d. l..kaddressing, assembler, covering problem, integerprogramming, variable-length addressing.c. . . .ca jb february ,   : pm
