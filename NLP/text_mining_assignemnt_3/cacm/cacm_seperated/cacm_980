multiple-precision arithmetic and the exactcalculation of the -j, -j and -j symbols.wdescribed in this paper is a system of general-purposemultiple-precision fixed-point routines and their use in subroutines which calculate exactlythe quantum-mechanical -j, -j and -j symbols of large arguments.cacm november, maer, r. m.redlich, m. g.ca jb march ,   : pm
