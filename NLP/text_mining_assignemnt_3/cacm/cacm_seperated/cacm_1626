structure of a lisp system using two-level storage.win an ideal list-processing system there wouldbe enough core memory to contain all the data and programs.  described in this paper are a numberof techniques that have been used to build a lisp system utilizing a drum for its principal storage medium, with a surprisingly low time penalty for use of this slow storage device.  the techniques includecareful segmentation of system programs, allocation of virtual memory to allow address arithmetic for typedetermination, and a special algorithm for building reasonably linearized lists.  a scheme for binding variablesis described which is good in this environment and allows for complete compatibility between compiledand interpreted programs with no special declarations.cacm march, bobrow, d. g.murphy, d. l.ca jb february ,   : pm
