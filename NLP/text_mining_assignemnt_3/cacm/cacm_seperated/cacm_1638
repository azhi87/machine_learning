sorting by replacement selecting.win sorting by replacement selecting, the expectedlength of a sequence beginning with the i-th element (i>) is proved to be f, in accordance witha conjecture of e. h. friend, where f is the number of memory cells used.  the expected length of the j-thsequence is determined to be f times a j-th degree polynomial in e, such that the value of this polynomialapproaches  as j approaches infinity.  recursive formulas are obtained for both the mean and the standarddeviation of the length of the j-th sequence.  the mathematical proofs of these results are basedupon the assumption that n, the number of items to be sorted, is infinite, but it is shown that the errordue to the finiteness of n approaches zero rapidly as n increases.cacm february, gasner, b. j.ca jb february ,   : pm
