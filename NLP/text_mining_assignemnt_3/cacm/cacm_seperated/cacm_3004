structured programming in cobol: an approach for application programmers.wtechniques for designing and writing cobol programsare presented.  previous work in structured programming is drawn upon and adapted.  the presentationis informal: the terminology is nonmathematical as far as possible, no theorems are proved, and examplesare used frequently.  top-down program design is implemented through the use of structured flowcharts,disciplined specifications, and step by step verification.  a well-formed cobol program is defined. the proper use of the go to and other cobol coding practices are discussed.cacm january, van gelder, a..kstructured programming, top-down, well-formed program,go to statement, repeat statement, flowchart, application programming, cobol, software reliability, program verification.c. . .ca jb january ,   : am
