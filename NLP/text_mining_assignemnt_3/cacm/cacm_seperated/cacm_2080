the nucleus of a multiprogramming system.wthis paper describes the philosophy and structure of a multiprogramming system that can be extended with a hierarchy of operating systems to suit diverse requirements of program scheduling and resource allocation.  the systemnucleus simulates an environment in which program execution and input/outputare handled uniformly as parallel, cooperating processes.  a fundamental set of primitives allows the dynamic creation and controlof a hierarchy of processes as well as the communication among them.cacm april, hansen, p. b..kmultiprogramming, operating systems, parallel processes, process concept,process communication, message buffering, processhierarchy, process creation, process removal.c. . . .ca jb february ,   : pm
