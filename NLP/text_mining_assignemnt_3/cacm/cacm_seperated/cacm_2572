arguments for a moratorium on the constructionof a community information utility.win this article the author urges a prudentand decentralized approach to the question of the design and desirability of computerized community informationutilities.  before accepting the inevitability and desirability of this or any technology, we should:() be sure of the feasibility (internally and externally) of what is proposed; () project and perhapswait for changes in complementary techniques; () evaluate current and projected supplementary techniques;() establish the existence of demand for what is proposed; () take steps to involve a representativegroup of ultimate users in systems design, and () carefully think through possible side effectson man and his world view.  current proposals for community information utilities are examined in thisframework, and the conclusion is drawn that society is not yet in a position to justify either the constructionof an information utility in a prototype community or the acceptance of a policy infavor of its widespread implementation.cacm december, press, l. i..kcommunity information utilities, social implications, public policy.c. .ca jb january ,   : am
