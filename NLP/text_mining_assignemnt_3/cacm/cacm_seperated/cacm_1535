a comment on index register allocation.wa technique is presented to reduce the enumerationrequired by a known procedure for optimal index register allocation in straight-line programs. this technique is based on the construction of a link diagram, which shows at any step the future occurrencesof indexes which must be loaded into index registers.  this diagram determines in advance the requiredregister configuration at certain steps of the program, so that the program is subdivided into separateportions to which the allocation procedure may be applied independently.cacm september, luccio, f.ca jb february ,   : pm
