the application of sequential samplingto simulation: an example inventory model.wfour different sequential sampling procedures are appliedto the analysis of data generated by a computer simulationexperiment with a multi-item inventory model.  for each procedurethe cost of computer time required to achieve given levels ofstatistical precision is calculated.  also the cost of computer timeusing comparable fixed sample size methods is calculated.  thecomputer costs of fixed sample size procedures versussequential sampling procedures are compared.cacm may, sasser, w. e.burdick, d. s.graham, d. a.naylor, t. h..ksimulation, inventory models, sequentialsampling, models, experimental design.c. . . .ca jb february ,   : pm
