reconstruction of pictures from their projections.wthere are situations in the natural sciencesand medicine (e.g. in electron microscopy and x-ray photography) in which it is desirable to estimate thegray levels of a digital picture at the individual points from the sums of the gray levels along straightlines (projections) at a few angles.  usually, in such situations, the picture is far from determinedand the problem is to find the "most representative" picture.  three algorithms are described (all usingmonte carlo methods) which were designed to solve this problem.  the algorithms are applicable in a largeand varied number of fields.  the most important uses may be the reconstruction of possibly asymmetric particlesfrom electron micrographs and three-dimensional x-ray analysis.cacm december, gordon,r.herman, g. t..kapproximation, biomedical image processing, efficientencoding, image processing, linear programming, mathematical programming, monte carlo techniques, optimization,picture compression, picture description, picture processing, stereology, x-ray analysis.c. . . . . . .ca jb february ,   : am
