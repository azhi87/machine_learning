efficient algorithms for graph manipulation [h] (algorithm a).wefficient algorithms are presented for partitioninga graph into connected components, biconnected components and simple paths.  the algorithm for partitioningof a graph into simple paths is iterative and each iteration produces a new path between twovertices already on paths.  (the start vertex can be specified dynamically.)  if v is the number of verticesand e is the number of edges, each algorithm requires time and space proportional to max (v,e)when executed on a random access computer.cacm june, hopcroft, j.tarjan, r..kgraphs,analysis of algorithms, graph manipulation.c.ca jb january ,   : pm
