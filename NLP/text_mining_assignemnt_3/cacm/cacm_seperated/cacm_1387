solution of systems of polynomial equations by elimination.wthe elimination procedure as described by williamshas been coded in lisp and formac and used in solving systems of polynomial equations.  it is foundthat the method is very effective in the case of small systems, where it yields all solutions withoutthe need for initial estimates. the method, by itself, appears in appropriate, however, in the solutionof large systems of equation due to the explosive growth in the intermediate equations and the hazardswhich arise when the coefficients are truncated.  a comparison is made with difficulties found in otherproblems in non-numerical mathematics such as symbolic integration and simplification.cacm august, moses, j.ca jb march ,   : pm
