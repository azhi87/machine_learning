early experience with mesa.wthe experiences of mesa's first users-primarilyits implementers-are discussed, and some implications for mesa and similar programming languages are suggested.the specific topics addressed are: module structure and its use in defining abstractions, data-structuringfacilities in mesa, an equivalence algorithm for types and type coercions, the benefits of the type systemand why it is breached occasionally, and the difficulty of making the treatment of variant records safe.cacm august, geschke, c. m.morris, j. h. jr.satterthwaite, e. h..kprogramming languages, types, modules,data structures, systems programming.c.ca jb december ,   : am
