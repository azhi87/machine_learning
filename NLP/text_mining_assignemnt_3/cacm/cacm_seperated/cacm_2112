translation equations.winput limited transduction expressions, or translation equations,are used to describe the syntax and left-context sensitive semantics for context-free languages.  a formal procedure is given for deriving froma set of translation equations the specifications for a pushdown translator.the translator consists of mealy form finite-state automata interactingby means of a pushdown stack.  within the framework described string recognition and parsing may be treated as special cases of the translation problem.cacm february, vere, s..kautomata, turing machines, regular expression, transductionexpression, context-free languages, translation, recognizers,parsing, meta-compilers, pushdown transducer, syntaxdirected compilers, finite state automata.c. . . .ca jb february ,   : am
