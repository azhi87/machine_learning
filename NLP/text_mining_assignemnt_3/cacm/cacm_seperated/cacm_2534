design and implementation of a diagnostic compiler for pl/i.wpl/c is a compiler for a dialect for pl/i.  thedesign objective was to provide a maximum degree of diagnostic assistance in a batch processing environment. for the most part this assistance is implicit and is provided automatically by the compiler. the most remarkablecharacteristic of pl/c is its perseverance-it completes translation of every program submitted andcontinues execution until a user-established error limit is reached. this requires that the compiler repairerrors encountered during both translation and execution, and the design of pl/c is dominated bythis consideration.  pl/c also introduces several explicit user-controlled facilities for program testing. to accommodate these extensions to pl/i without abandoning compatibility with ibm compiler pl/c permits"pseudo comments"-constructions whose contents can optionally be considered either source test or comment. in spite of the diagnostic effort pl/c is a fast and efficient processor.  it effectively demonstratesthat compilers can provide better diagnostic assistance than is customarily offered, even when a sophisticatedsource language is employed, and that this assistance need not be prohibitively costly.cacm march, conway, r. w.wilcox, t. r..kcompilers, debugging, pl/i, programming languages.c. . .ca jb january ,   : am
