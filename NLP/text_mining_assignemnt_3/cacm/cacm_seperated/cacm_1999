optimal starting approximations for generatingsquare root for slow or no divide.won machine with slow or no division, it is preferable touse an iterative scheme for the square root different fromthe classical heron scheme.  the problem of optimal initial approximants is considered, and some optimal polynomial initial approximations are tabulated.cacm september, wilson, m. w..ksquare root, newton-raphson iteration, optimal approximants.c.ca jb february ,   : pm
