a global parser for context-free phrase structure grammars.wan algorithm for analyzing any context-free phrasestructure grammar and for generating a program which can then parse any sentence in the language (orindicate that the given sentence is invalid) is described. the parser is of the "top-to-bottom" typeand is recursive . a number of heuristic procedures whose purpose is to shorten the basic algorithm by quicklyascertaining that certain substrings of the input sentence cannot correspond to the target nonterminalsymbols are included.  both the generating algorithm and the parser have been implemented in rcasnobol and have been tested successfully on a number of artificial grammars and on a subset of algol.  anumber of the routines for extracting data about a grammar, such as minimum lengths of n-derivable stringsand possible prefixes, are given and may be of interest apart from their application in this particular context.cacm april, unger, s. h..kparser, syntax-directed compiler, context-freegrammars, syntactic analysis, translators.c. . .ca jb february ,   : am
