glypnir-a programming language for illiac iv.wglypnir is one of the earliest existing languagesdesigned for programming the illiac iv computer. the syntax of the language is based on algol , but hasbeen extended to allow the programmer explicitly to specify the parallelism of his algorithm in terms of -wordvectors.  this paper describes the characteristics, goals and philosophy of the language, and discusses someof the problems associated with parallel computer architectures.cacm march, lawrie, d. h.layman, t.baer, d.randal, j. m..kglypnir, illiac iv, programming language,parallel computation, parallel architecture.c. . .cajb january ,   : pm
