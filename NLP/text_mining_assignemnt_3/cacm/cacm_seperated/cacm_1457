data manipulation and programming problemsin automatic information retrieval.wautomatic information retrieval programs requirethe manipulation of a variety of different data structures, including linear text, sparse matrices,and tree or list structures.  the main data manipulations to be performed in automatic informationsystems are first briefly reviewed.  a variety of data representations which have been used to describestructured information are then examined, and the characteristics of various processing languages areoutlined in the light of the procedures requiring implementation.  advantages of these programming languagesfor the retrieval application are examined, and suggestions are made for the design of programmingfacilities to aid in information retrieval.cacm march, salton, g.ca jb march ,   : am
