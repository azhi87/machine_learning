graph coloring conditions for the existenceof solutions to the timetable problem.wa necessary and sufficient condition is presentedfor the existence of a solution to the gotlieb class-teacher timetable problem.  several relationshipsare established between the class-teacher timetable problem and graphs with preconditions.  these preconditionsplace additional restrictions on the coloration of a graph.  the preconditions correspond to the unavailabilityconstraints and preassigned meetings in the class-teacher timetable problem.  using some recentresults that convert graphs with preconditions to graphs without them, it is shown that the existenceof a coloration of a graph is the required necessary and sufficient condition.cacm august, neufeld, g. a.tartar, j..kgraphs, coloration, preassignment, preventionof assignment, class-teacher timetables.c. . . .ca jb january ,   : am
