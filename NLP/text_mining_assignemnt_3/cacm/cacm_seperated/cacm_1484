a language for describing the functions of synchronous systems* .wbefore the design of a system is started, theexact function desired of it should be specified.  it is suggested that a computer-oriented language beused for this purpose.  the inadequacies of the standard programming languages for the description ofsystems are discussed, and a dialect of algol which is suitable for describing synchronous systems is introduced. these descriptions can be used for simulation and automatic design of the system described, inaddition to communicating system specifications.cacm february, parnas, d. l.ca jb march ,   : pm
