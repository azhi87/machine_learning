a base for a mobile programming system.wan algorithm for a macro processor which hasbeen used as the base of an implementation, by bootstrapping, of processors for programming languages isdescribed.  this algorithm can be easily implemented on contemporary computing machines.  experience withprogramming languages whose implementation is basedon this algorithm indicates that such a language canbe transferred to a new machine in less than one man-week without using the old machine.cacm september, orgass, r. j.waite, w. m..kbootstrapping, macro processing, machine independence,programming languages, implementation techniques.c. .ca jb february ,   : pm
