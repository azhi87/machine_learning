on the distributions of significant digits and roundoff errors.wgeneralized logarithmic law is derived forthe distribution of the first t significant digits of a random digital integer.  this result is then usedto determine the distribution of the roundoff errors in floating-point operations, which is a mixtureof uniform and reciprocal distributions.cacm may, tsao, n..ksignificant digits, floating-point operations,roundoff errors, uniform distribution, reciprocal distribution, variance, mean valve.c. .ca jb january ,   : pm
