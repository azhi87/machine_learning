optimizing the polyphase sort.wvarious dispersion algorithms for the polyphasesorting procedure are examined.the optimum algorithm based on minimizing the total number of unitstrings read is displayed.  the logic of this algorithm is rather complicated; hence, several othernew dispersion algorithms with more straightforward logic are presented.  of the simple dispersion algorithmsdiscussed, the  horizontal is best.  it does approximately one-fourth to one and one-half percentless reading and writing than most algorithms in use today.  an additional two and one-fourth to threepercent improvement can be achieved by utilizing the modified optimum algorithm.  this algorithm is relativelystraightforward, but it requires a fairly close estimate of the total number of unit strings before the dispersion begins.cacm november, shell, d. l..ksorting, polyphase sorting, dispersion algorithms,optimum dispersion algorithm, repetition operator.c.ca jb february ,   : am
