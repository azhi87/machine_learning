generalized working sets for segment reference strings.wthe working-set concept is extended for programsthat reference segments of different sizes.  the generalized working-set policy (gws) keeps as itsresident set those segments whose retention costs do not exceed their retrieval costs.  the gws is a modelfor the entire class of demand-fetching memory policies that satisfy a resident-set inclusion property. a generalized optimal policy (gopt) is also defined; at its operating points it minimizes aggregatedretention and swapping costs.  special cases of the cost structure allow gws and gopt to simulateany known stack algorithm, the working set, and vmin.  efficient procedures for computing demand curvesshowing swapping load as a function of memory usage are developed for gws and gopt policies.  empiricaldata from an actual system are included.cacm september, denning, p.j.slutz, d.r..kdatabase referencing, memory management, optimalmemory policies, paging, program behavior, program measurement, segmentation, working sets.c. .ca dh february ,   : am
