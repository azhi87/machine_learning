techniques for the simulation of computer logic.wthe simulation of a digital computer is anintegral part of most computer design automation systems.  the evaluation of the boolean functions whichcharacterize the computer being simulated constitutes one major portion of a simulation system.  four generalprocedural classes for evaluating these functions are defined.  toward greatly increased efficiency of a simulationsystem, methods are presented for simultaneously evaluating many functions for one set of values of thevariables,and for evaluating simultaneously one function for many sets of values for the variables.cacm july, breuer,m. a.ca jb march ,   : pm
