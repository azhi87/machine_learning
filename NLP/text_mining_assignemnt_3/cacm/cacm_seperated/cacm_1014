machine controls for analysis of variance.wa major problem in using the analysis of variance,as the number of factors increases, is the exponential rise in the number of interactions.  eventhough the experimenter may not be interested in these interactions it is impossible to ignore them inmost experimental designs because of the problem of getting error terms.  it is natural therefore to lookto the computer to handle the bulk of work involved in computing the interactions.  a program deviceto get the computer to do this is described.cacm august, weldon, r. j.ca jb march ,   : pm
