an interactive display for approximation by linear programming.wan interactive programwith a graphical display has been developed for the approximation ofdata by means of a linear combination of functions (includingsplines) selected by the user.  the coefficients of the approximationare determined by linear programming so as to minimize the errorin either the l or l-infinity norm.  auxiliary conditions such asmonotonicity or convexity of the approximation can also be imposed. thisinteractive system is described and several examples of its use are given.cacm november, lafata, p.rosen, j. b..kapproximation, data fitting, functional approximation, linearprogramming, interactive graphical display, spline functions.c. .ca jb february ,   : am
