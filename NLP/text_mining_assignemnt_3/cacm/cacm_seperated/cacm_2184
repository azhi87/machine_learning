on the meaning of names in programming systems.wit is assumed that there is a similarity offunction between the data names of a programming language and the file names of an operating system. the two functions are discussed in terms of the same basic concepts in order to identify the extentto which they overlap. it is suggested that there is some similarity between the idea of a file directoryand a storable object of type context.  manipulations with contexts are then discussed at length.  it is notedthat there is a simple extension of church's lambda notation that deals nicely with these ideas ofcontext manipulation.  whereas a function can be regarded as the abstraction based upon the first two terms ofthe expression lambda(name list)(expression)(value list), it is found that a context can be viewed as an abstractionbased upon the first two terms in the equivalent expression mu(name list)(value list)(expression).cacm july, fraser, a. g..kfile, operating system, programming language, functions,names, context, file directory, file dictionary, lambda calculus, theory of programming.c. . . . .ca jb february ,   : am
