the control of response times in multi-classsystems by memory allocations .wthe possibility of giving different quality of service to jobs of differentclasses by regulating their memory allocation is examined inthe context of a paged computer system.  two parameterized algorithmswhich partition the main memory between two classes of jobs areconsidered.  initially, a closed system consisting of a processor and paging and file devices, with fixed numbers of jobs, is studiedto determine optimal degrees of multiprogramming and the proportionof processor time devoted to each class.  applying a decompositionapproach and treating the closed system as a single server,the response times in an open system with external arrivals arestudied.  the object is to investigate the effect of the memoryalocation parameters on the expected response times under the two algorithms.numerical solutions and economical lower bounds for theexpected response times as functions of the control parametersare obtained.  a way of applying the results to systems with morethan two job classes is indicated.cacm july, hine, j.h.mitrani, i.tsur, s..kqueueing networks, paging, virtual memory, performance control.c. .ca dh august ,   : pm
