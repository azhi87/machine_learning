one-pass compilation of arithmetic expressions for a parallel processor.wunder the assumption that a processor may havea multiplicity of arithmetic units, a compiler for such a processor should produce object code to takeadvantage of possible parallelism of operation.  most of the presently known compilation techniquesare inadequate for such a processor because they produce expression structures that must be evaluated serially. a technique is presented here for compiling arithmetic expressions into structures that can beevaluated with a high degree of parallelism.  the algorithm is a variant of the so-called "top-down"analysis technique, and requires only one pass of the input text.cacm april, stone, h. s.ca jb february ,   : am
