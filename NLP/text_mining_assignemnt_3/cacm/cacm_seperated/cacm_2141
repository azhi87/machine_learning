algorithmic selection of the bestmethod for compressing map data strings.wthe best of a dozen different methods forcompressing map data is illustrated.  the choices are generated by encoding data strings-sequence of likecodes-by three methods and in four directions.  relationships are developed between compression alternativesto avoid comparing all of them.  the technique has been used to compress data from forest resource maps,but is widely applicable to map and photographic data reduction.cacm december, amidon, e. l.akin, g. s..kdata compression, map storage, information retrieval,input/output, run coding, data reduction.c. .ca jb february ,   : am
