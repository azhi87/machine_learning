regular expression search algorithm.wa method for locating specific character stringsembedded in character text is described and an implementation of this method in the form of a compileris discussed.  the compiler accepts a regular expression as source language and produces an ibm program as object language.  the object program then accepts the text to be searched as input and producesa signal every time an embedded string in the text matches the given regular expression.  examples,problems, and solution are also presented.cacm june, thompson, k..ksearch, match, regular expression.c. . .ca jb february ,   : pm
