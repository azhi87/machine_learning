performance of rollback recovery systems under intermittent failures.wa mathematical model of a transaction-orientedsystem under intermittent failures is proposed.  the system is assumed to operate with a checkpointingand rollback/recovery method to ensure reliable information processing.  the model is used to derive theprincipal performance measures, including availability, response time, and the system saturation point.   cacm june, gelenbe, e.derochette, d..kdatabase reliability, file systems, checkpoints, recoveryprocedures, checking techniques, reliability and system performance evaluation.c. . . . . . .ca dh february ,   : am
