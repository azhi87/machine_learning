an improved program-synthesizing algorithm and its correctness.wan improved program-synthesizing algorithmbased on the algorithm proposed by waldinger and lee in  is given.  in the old algorithm, the program-synthesizingproblem is translated into a theorem-proving problem, and a program is obtained by analyzing a proof. for the improved algorithm, the analysis is not necessary, and a program is obtained as soon asthe proof is completed.  this is achieved by using a modified variable tracing mechanism invented by greenin .  the correctness of the improved algorithm is also proved; i.e. the program thus obtainedalways satisfies the specification.cacm april, lee, r. c. t.chang, c. l.waldinger, r. j..kprogram-synthesizing algorithms, theorem proving,consequence finding, primitive resolutions.c. . . . . . .ca jb january ,   : am
