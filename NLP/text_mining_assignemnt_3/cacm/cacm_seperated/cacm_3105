a language extension for expressing constraints on data access.wcontrolled sharing of information is needed anddesirable for many applications and is supported in operating systems by access control mechanisms.  thispaper shows how to extend programming languages to provide controlled sharing.  the extension permitsexpression of access constraints on shared data.  access constraints can apply both to simple objects, andto objects that are components of larger objects, such as bank account records in a bank's data base. the constraints are stated declaratively, and can be enforced by static checking similar to type checking. the approach can be used to extend any strongly-typed language, but is particularly suitable for extendinglanguages that support the notion of abstract data types. cacm may, jones, a.k.liskov,b.h..kprogramming languages, access control, data types,abstract data types, type checking, capabilities.c. .ca dh february ,   : pm
