minimal-total-processing time drum and disk scheduling disciplines.wthis article investigates the application ofminimal-total-processing-time (mtpt) scheduling disciplines to rotating storage units when random arrivalof requests is allowed.  fixed-head drum and moving-head drum and moving-head disk storage units areconsidered, and emphasis is placed on the relative merits of the mtpt scheduling discipline with respectto the shortest-latency-time-first (sltf) scheduling discipline.  the results of the simulation studiespresented show that neither scheduling discipline is unconditionally superior to the other.  for mostfixed-head drum applications, the sltf discipline is preferable to mtpt, but for intra-cylinder disk schedulingthe mtpt discipline offers a distinct advantage over the sltf discipline.  the computational requirementsof an algorithm that implements the mtpt scheduling discipline are shown to be comparable to sltf algorithms.in both cases, the sorting procedure is the most time-consuming phase of the algorithm.cacm july, fuller, s. h..kdrum scheduling, disk scheduling, shortest-latency-time-first(sltf), minimal-total-processing-time (mtpt), rotating storage units.c. . . .ca jb january ,   : pm
