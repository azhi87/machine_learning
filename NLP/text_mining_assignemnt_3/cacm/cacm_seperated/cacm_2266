a highly parallel algorithm for approximatingall zeros of a polynomial with only real zeros.wan algorithm is described based on newton'smethod which simultaneously approximates all zeros of a polynomial with only real zeros.  the algorithm, whichis conceptually suitable for parallel computation, determines its own starting values so that convergenceto the zeros is guaranteed.  multiple zeros and their multiplicity are readily determined.  at nopoint in the method is polynomial deflation used.cacm november, patrick, m. l..kparallel numerical algorithms, real polynomials,real zeros, newton's method, starting values, guaranteed convergence.c.ca jb january ,   : pm
