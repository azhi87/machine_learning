on the construction of a representative synthetic workload.wa general method of constructing a drive workloadrepresentative of a real workload is described. the real workload is characterized by its demands on thevarious system resources.  these characteristics of the real workload are obtained from the system accountingdata. the characteristics of the drive workload are determined by matching the joint probability densityof the real workload with that of the drive workload.  the drive workload is realized by using asynthetic program in which the characteristics can be varied by varying the appropriate parameters. calibrationexperiments are conducted to determine expressions relating the synthetic program parameters with the workloadcharacteristics.  the general method is applied to the case of two variables, cpu seconds and numberof i/o activities; and synthetic workload with  jobs is constructed to represent a month'sworkload consisting of about  jobs.cacm march, sreenivasan, k.kleinman, a. j..kbenchmarks, calibration, drive workload, input tosimulation, probability distribution, representative workload, synthetic workload, workload characteristics.c. . .ca jb january ,   : pm
