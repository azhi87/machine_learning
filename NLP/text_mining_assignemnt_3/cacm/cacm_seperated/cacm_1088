menu planning by computer.wa computer code has been developed which plansmenus by finding minimum cost combinations of menu items such that the daily dietary, gastronomicand production requirements can be satisfied for a sequence of days.  a fast, special integer programmingalgorithm is described which approximates the theoretical solution to the problem.  if necessary, anymenu can be changed on-line and then post-optimized.  up to  percent saving on food cost is possible. a fortran program for the ibm  is available on request.  a considerable amount of data processingmust precede the implementation of the system.cacm april, balistfy, j. l.ca jb march ,   : am
