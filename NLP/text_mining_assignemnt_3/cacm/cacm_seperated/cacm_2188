an approach to the optimum design of computer graphics systems.wdisplay system designers are faced with thedifficult task of selecting major subsystems in an intelligent way.  each subsystem is chosen from largenumbers of alternatives; the selection is based on considerations such as system response time, systemcost, and the distribution of data storage and processing between the graphics processor and its supportingdata processing system.  the work reported here develops an objective, quantitative design procedureand helps give a better understanding of now to  configure display systems.  this is accomplished bymeans of a mathematical model of a computer driven graphics system.  the parameters of the model are functionsof the capabilities of the graphics hardware and of the computational requirements of the graphics application. the model can be analyzed using numerical queueing analysis or simulation to obtain an averageresponse time prediction.  by combining the model with an optimization, the best graphics system configuration,subject to a cost constraint, is found for several applications.  the optimum configurationsare in turn used to find general display system design guidelines.cacm june, foley, j. d..kdesign guidelines, graphic display systems, mathematicalmodel, optimum system design, queueing model.c. . .ca jb february ,   : am
