the composition of semantics in algol .wthe main features of algol  are explainedfrom a semantic point of view.  it is shown how the language permits the composition of values and actions,i.e. ultimately programs, from a minimum set of primitives with a few fundamental recursive rulesof composition.  the associated syntax is briefly reviewed.  an attempt has been made to obtain a structuredand simple introduction to both algol  and its orthogonal design.cacm november, branquart, p.lewi, j.sintzoff, m.wodon, p. l..kprogramming primitives, programming languages,algol, semantics, recursive composition, design of programming languages, data structures.c. . . . .ca jb february ,   : am
