analysis of a file addressing method.wthis paper presents a new file addressing methodbased on the calculation of an address from the identification of a record.  for large recirculatingtype files, it seems to be more advantageous than customary ones.  the probability distribution ofthe displacement of records from their calculated address, which is one less than the number of probesrequired to address a record, is computed on the basis of a markov chain model.  for the reader not interestedin the mathematics, the introduction and the summary should be sufficient.cacm august, schay jr., g.spruth, w. g.ca jb march ,   : pm
