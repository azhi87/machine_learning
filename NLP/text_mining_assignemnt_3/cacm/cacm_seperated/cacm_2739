the restriction language for computer grammars of natural language.wover the past few years, a number of systemsfor the computer analysis of natural language sentences have been based on augmented context-freegrammars: a context-free grammar which defines a set of parse trees for a sentence, plus a group of restrictionsto which a tree must conform in order to be a valid sentence analysis.  as the coverage of thegrammar is increased, an efficient representation becomes essential for further development.  this paperpresents a programming language designed specifically for the compact and perspicuous statement of restrictionsof a natural language grammar.  it is based on ten years' experience parsing text sentences withthe comprehensive english grammar of the n.y.u. linguistic string project, and embodies in its syntaxand routines the relations which were found to be useful and adequate for computerized natural languageanalysis.  the language is used in the current implementation of the linguistic string parser.cacm july sager, n.grishman, r..knatural language, parsing, grammar, programming languages.c. . .ca jb january ,   : am
