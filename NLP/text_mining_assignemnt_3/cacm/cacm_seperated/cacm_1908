time-sharing and batch-processing:  an experimentalcomparison of their values in a problem - solving situation.wan experimental comparison of problem-solvingusing time-sharing and batch-processing computer systems conducted at mit is described in this paper. this study is the first known attempt to evaluate two such systems for what may well be the predominant userpopulation within the next decade-the professionals who, as nonprogrammers, are using the computer as anaid in decision-making and problem-solving rather than as a programming end in itself.  statisticallyand logically significant results indicate equal cost for usage of the two computer systems; however,a much higher level of performance is attained by time-sharing users.  there are indications that significantlylower costs would have resulted if the time-sharing users had stopped work when they reacheda performance level equal to that of the batch users.  the users' speed of problem-solving and theirattitudes made time-sharing the more favorable system.cacm may, gold, m. m..ktime-sharing vs batch-processing, user performance,man/machine communications, cost effectiveness, on-line vs off-line performance, decision-making performance,user/programmer behavior, programming experimental empirical studies, problem-solving, research in man/machinecommunications, man/machine symbiosis.c. . . . .ca jb february ,   : pm
