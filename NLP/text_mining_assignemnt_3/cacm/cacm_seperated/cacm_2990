effective information retrieval using term accuracy.wthe performance of information retrieval systemscan be evaluated in a number of different ways.  much of the published evaluation work is basedon measuring the retrieval performance of an average user query.  unfortunately, formal proofs are difficultto construct for the average case.  in the present study, retrieval evaluation is based on optimizing theperformance of a specific user query.  the concept of query term accuracy is in troduced as the probabilityof occurrence of a query term in the documents relevant to that query.  by relating term accuracyto the frequency of occurrence of the term in the documents of a collection it is possible to give formalproofs of the effectiveness with respect to a given user query of a number of automatic indexing systemsthat have been used successfully in experimental situations.  among these are inverse document frequencyweighting, thesaurus construction, and phrase generation.cacm march, yu, c. t.salton, g..kinformation retrieval, automatic indexing, contentanalysis, term accuracy, frequency weighting, thesaurus and phrase transformations.c. . .ca jb december ,   : am
