copying cyclic list structures in linear time using bounded workspace.wa bounded workspace copying algorithm for arbitrarylist structures is given.  this algorithm operates in linear time and does not require tag bits. the best previous bounded workspace copying algorithms achieved n^ time without tag bits and n log n time withone tag.  the only restriction on the algorithm given here is that the copy must be placed into a contiguoussection of memory.  the method is applicable to fixed or variable size nodes.cacm may, fisher, d. a..klist processing, copying, linear time, space complexity.c. .ca jb january ,   : pm
