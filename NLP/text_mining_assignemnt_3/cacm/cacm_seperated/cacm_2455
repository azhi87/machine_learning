a generalization of avl trees.wa generalization of avl trees is proposed inwhich imbalances up to (triangle shape) is a small integer.  an experiment is performed to compare thesetrees with standard avl trees and with balanced trees on the basis of mean retrieval time, of amountof restructuring expected, and on the worst case of retrieval time.  it is shown that, by permittingimbalances of up to five units, the retrieval time is increased a small amount while the amount of restructuringrequired is decreased by a factor of ten.  a few theoretical results are derived, including the correctionof an earlier paper, and are duly compared with the experimental data.  reasonably good correspondence is found.cacm august, foster, c. c..kavl trees, balanced trees, information storage and retrieval.c. . . .ca jb january ,   : am
