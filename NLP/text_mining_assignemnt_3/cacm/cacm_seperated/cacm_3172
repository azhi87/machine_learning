an algorithm for planning collision-freepaths among polyhedral obstacles.wthis paper describes a collision avoidance algorithmfor planning a safe path for a polyhedral object moving amongknown polyhedral objects.  the algorithm transforms the obstaclesso that they represent the locus of forbidden positions for an arbitraryreference point on the moving object.  a trajectory of thisreference point which avoids all forbidden regions is free of collisions.trajectories are found by searching a network which indicates, for each vertex in the transformed obstacles, which other vertices can be reached safely.cacm october, lozano-perez, t.wesley, m.a..kpath finding, collision-free paths, polyhedral objects,polyhedral obstacles, graph searching, growing objects.c. . . .ca db january ,   : am
