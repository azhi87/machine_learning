a model for automating file and program design in business application systems.wthis paper discusses a model for finding an efficient implementation of a business application system whose logical specifications have been determinedin advance.  the model views file and program design as a problemof systematically coordinating the configurations of datasets andcomputations.  it uses a straight forward search technique todetermine aggregations of computations, aggregations of datasets, device,organization, and key order for each data set, key order for each computation, and access method  for each dataset-computationpair.  although computational results are presented for a sampleproblem involving  computations and  datasets, the main point ofthe paper is that the underlying model works computationally and is simple enough to be adapted to many file design situations.cacm june, alter, s..ksystem design, automatic programming, searchmethods, system configurations, design choices.c. . .ca dh august ,   : pm
