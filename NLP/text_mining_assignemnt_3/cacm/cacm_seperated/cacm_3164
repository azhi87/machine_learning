progressive acyclic digraphs-a tool for database integrity.wa progressive acyclic digraph (pad) algorithm accepts are requests andmaintains a graph in an acyclic state.  when a request creates a cycle,nodes are, "detached" until the new are can be entered acyclicallythis process is important in certain areas of database implementationin which there are constraints on the permissible sequencesof actions. two pad algorithms are presented; one uses a simplepath matrix representation and the other uses a list with an"artificial gradient."  experiments suggest that for large n the secondis considerably faster, though both are asymptotically o(nr),where n is the number of nodes and r is the expected numberof nodes reachable along paths from any given node.cacm september, hansen, w.j..klist processing, data structures, topological sort,acyclic digraph, database integrity, network, deadlock.c. . .ca db january ,   : am
