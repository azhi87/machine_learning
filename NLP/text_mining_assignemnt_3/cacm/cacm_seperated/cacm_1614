a proposal for definitions in algol.wan extension to algol is proposed for addingnew data types and operators to the language.  definitions may occur in any block heading and terminatewith the block.  they are an integral part of the program and are not fixed in the language.  eventhe behavior of existing operators may be redefined.  the processing of text containing defined contexts featuresa "replacement rule" that eliminates unnecessary iterations and temporary storage.  examples of definition setsare given for real and complex matrices, complex numbers, file processing, and list manipulation.cacm april, galler, b. a.perlis, a. j.ca jb february ,   : am
