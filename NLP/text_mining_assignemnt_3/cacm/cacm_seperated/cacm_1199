a computer center simulation project.wtoday's computation centers are based on rapidlychanging technologies of hardware and software systems.  it is difficult, therefore, to base decisionson experience; in most instances, the benefits of comparable experience for a given problem situationare not available.  in this paper, a mathematical model of the lockheed central computer center is formulatedthat describes the operation of a computation center in terms of information nets, decision processes,and control functions.  experiments performed with this model, the results of the experiments,and the application of the results are discussed.cacm september, hutchinson, g. k.cajb march ,   : pm
