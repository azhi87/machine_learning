a fast algorithm for computing longest common subsequences.wpreviously published algorithms for findingthe longest common subsequence of two sequences of length n have had a best-case running time of o(n^). an algorithm for this problem is presented which has a running time of o((r + n)log n), where ris the total number of ordered pairs of positions at which the two sequences match.  thus in the worstcase the algorithm has a running time of o(n^ log n).  however, for those applications where most positionsof one sequence match relatively few positions in the other sequence, a running time of o(n log n) can be expected.cacm may, hunt, j. w.szymanski, t. g..klongest common subsequence, efficient algorithms.c. . .ca jb december ,   : am
