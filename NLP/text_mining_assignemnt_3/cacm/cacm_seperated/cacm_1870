some techniques for using pseudorandom numbers in computer simulation.wan algorithm is described by which uniform pseudorandomintegers may be used to construct binary "numbers" in which the probability that each bit in theword is a -bit and can assume any desired parameter value.  techniques for making use of such "numbers"in simulation programming are described.cacm july, donnelly, t..krandom numbers,  simulation, boolean algebra, bit manipulation.c. .ca jb february ,   : am
