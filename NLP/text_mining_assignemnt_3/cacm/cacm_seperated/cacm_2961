experimental investigations of the utilityof detailed flowcharts in programming.wthis paper describes previous research onflowcharts and a series of controlled experiments to test the utility of detailed flowcharts as an aidto program composition, comprehension, debugging, and modification.  no statistically significant differencebetween flowchart and nonflowchart groups has been shown, thereby calling into question the utilityof detailed flowcharting.  a program of further research is suggested.cacm june, shneiderman, b.mayer, r.mckay, d.heller, p..kflowcharts, program composition, program comprehension,debugging, modification, experimental testing, human factors.c. .ca jb december ,   : am
