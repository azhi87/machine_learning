on shrinking binary picture patterns.wa parallel processing algorithm for shrinkingbinary patterns to obtain single isolated elements, one for each pattern, is presented.  this proceduremay be used for counting patterns on a matrix, and a hardware implementation of the algorithm using largescale integrated technology is envisioned.  the principal features of this method are the very smallwindow employed (two-by-two elements), the parallel nature of the process, and the possibility of shrinkingany pattern, regardless of the complexity of its configuration.  problems regarding merging and disconnectionof patterns during the process as well as the determination of the maximum number of stepsnecessary to obtain a single isolated element from a pattern, are reviewed and discussed.  an analogy with aneural network description, in terms of mcculloch-pitts "neurons" is presented.cacm january, levialdi, s..kcounting binary patterns, shrinking, parallelprocessing, multiple connected pictures.c.ca jb february ,   : am
