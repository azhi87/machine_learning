cat: a - computer-aided translation.wa semi-automatic translation system has been implementedwhich converts  fap language programs into  assembly language.  the input to the systemis a fap program deck which has been specially prepared for translation by the user.  the output consistsof the translated compass language program together with a comprehensive diagnostic listing which theuser must analyze in order to verify any questionable areas of the translation.  the translation processorconsists of three distinct phases: an assembly of the fap program, a comprehensive analysis of the assembledcode with particular regard to the actions of instructions upon other instructions and upon data,and finally the output pass which generates the compass program in the form of macro instructions.cacm december, wilson, d. m. moss, d. j.ca jb march ,   : pm
