use of transition matrices in compiling.wan algorithms is described which constructsfrom a suitable bnf grammar an efficient left-right recognizer for sentences of the corresponding language. the type of recognizer, used in a number of compilers, operates with a pushdown stack and witha transition matrix.  two examples illustrate how such recognizers may be used effectively for otherpurposes besides the usual syntax checking.cacm january, gries, d..ktransition matrices, compilation, translation,grammar, context-free language, formal language, parsing.c. .ca jb february ,   : pm
