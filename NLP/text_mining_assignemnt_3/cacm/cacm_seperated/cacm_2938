toward a discipline of real-time programming.wprogramming is divided into three major categorieswith increasing complexity of reasoning in program validation: sequential programming, multiprogramming,and real-time programming.  by adhering to a strict programming discipline and by using a suitablehigh-level language molded after this discipline, the complexity of reasoning about concurrency and executiontime constrain ts may be drastically reduced.  this may be the only practical way to make real-timesystems analytically verifiable and ultimately reliable.  a possible discipline is outlined andexpressed in terms of the language modula.cacm august, wirth, n..kmultiprogramming, real-time programming, process synchronization,processor sharing, program validation, modula.c. .ca jb december , : am
