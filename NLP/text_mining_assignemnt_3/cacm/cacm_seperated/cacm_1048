approximate solution of axially symmetric problems.wa variety of physical problems in such diversefields as electrostatic  field theory, heat and ideal fluid flow, and stress concentration theoryreduce, under the assumption of axial symmetry, to the study of an elliptic partial differential equation. dirichlet-type problems associated with this equation are studied on regions whose boundaries includea nondegenerate portion of the x-axis and exceedingly accurate numerical methods are given for approximating solutions.cacm june, greenspan, d.ca jb march ,   : pm
