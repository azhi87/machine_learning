a language extension for graph processing and its formal semantics.wa simple programming language "extension,"graspe, for processing directed graphs is defined.  graspe consists of a type of directed graph data structureand a set of primitive operations for manipulating these structures.  graspe may be most easily implementedby embedding it in a host language.  emphasis is placed both on graspe itself and on its method ofdefinition.  commonly, the definition of a language involves definition of the syntactic elements and explanationof the meaning to be assigned them (the semantics).  the definition of graspe here is solely interms of its semantics; that is, the data structures and operations are defined precisely but without assignmentof a particular syntactic representation.  only when the language is implemented is assignmentof an explicit syntax necessary.  an example of an implementation of graspe embedded in lisp is given asan illustration.  the advantages and disadvantages of the definition of a language in terms of its semantics are discussed.cacm july, pratt, t. w.friedman, d. p..kgraph processing, programming language, formal semantics,directed graph, lisp, network, data structure, flowchart, syntax, language definition.c. . . . .ca jb february ,   : am
