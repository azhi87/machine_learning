sampling from the gamma distribution on a computer.wthis paper describes a method of generatinggamma variates that appears to be less costly than wallace's recently suggested method.  for large shape parameter(a); the cost of computation is proportional to (a), whereas wallace's method is proportional to (a). experimentation by robinson and lewis indicates that for small (a) the method suggested here also dominatesmethods recently suggested by dieter and ahrens, albeit those methods dominate for large (a).  themethod suggested here uses the rejection technique.cacm july, fishman, g. s..kgamma variates, reflection method, sampling.c. . .ca jb january ,   : pm
