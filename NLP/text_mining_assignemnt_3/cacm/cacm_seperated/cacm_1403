a method for finding the m smallest values ofa monotonic function defined on ordered sets of positive integers.wthe minimum value of a monotonic increasingfunction defined on a partially ordered set s is assumed on the set of minimal points of s.  this observationis used to devise an efficient method for finding the m smallest functional values of monotonicfunctions defined on ordered pairs of positive integers.  the method is easily extended to includemonotonic functions defined on ordered n-tuples.  included is a fortran program which was written to implementthe procedure for a certain important case.cacm july, sigillito, v. g.ca jb march ,   : pm
