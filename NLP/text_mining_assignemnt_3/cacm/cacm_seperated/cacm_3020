systematic recursion removal.wthe recursion removal algorithm presentedby strong and walker is amplified and applied to a relatively complex pl/i program.  the aim is to demonstratesystematic recursion-removal techniques on something more complex than knuth's "sturdy toddler"and to obtain measurements of the cost of procedure linkage in pl/i and the savings achievable via procedureintegration in the presence of recursion.  first, the paper describes the recursion-removal process and theexample on which it will be illustrated.  recursion removal is then applied to the two major parts of thisexample and the final result of the process is displayed.  our performance comparison results are presentedand our conclusions are briefly discussed. cacm february, auslander, m.a.strong, h.r..krecursion removal, recursion elimination, optimization,procedure linkage, procedure integration.c. . . .ca jb march ,   : pm
