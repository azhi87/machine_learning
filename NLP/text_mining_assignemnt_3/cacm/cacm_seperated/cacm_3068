a model for verification of data security in operating systems.wprogram verification applied to kernel architecturesforms a promising method for providing uncircumventably secure, shared computer systems.  aprecise definition of data security is developed here in terms of a general model for operating systems. this model is suitable as a basis for verifying many of those properties of an operating system whichare necessary to assure reliable enforcement of security.  the application of this approach to theucla secure operating system is also discussed. cacm september, popek, g.j..farber, d.a..koperating systems, security, protection, program verification.c. .ca dh february ,   : pm
