polynomial and spline approximation by quadratic programming.wthe problem of approximation to a given function,or of fitting a given set of data, where the approximating function is required to have certainof its derivations of specified sign over the whole range of approximation, is studied.  two approachesare presented, in each of which quadratic programming is used to provide both the constraints on the derivativesand the selection of the function which yields the best fit.  the first is a modified bernstein polynomialscheme, and the second is a spline fit.cacm july, amos, d. e.slater, m. l..kconstant sign derivatives, bernstein polynomials,linear concavity constraints, quadratic programming splines.c. .ca jb february ,   : am
