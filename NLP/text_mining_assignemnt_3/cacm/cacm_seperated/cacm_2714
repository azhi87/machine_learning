merging with parallel processors.wconsider two linearly ordered sets a, b, |a|=m,|b|=n, m<=n, and p, p<=m, parallel processors working synchronously.  the paper presents an algorithmfor merging a and b with the p parallel processors, which requires at most [log (m+)]+[m/p] + [m/p][log(n/m)] steps.  if n = (^b)m (b an integer), the algorithm requires at most [log (m+)] + [m/p](+b)steps.  in the case where m and n are of the same order of magnitude, i.e. n=km with k being a constant,the algorithm requires [log (m+)] + [m/p](+k) steps.  these performances compare very favorably withthe previous best parallel merging algorithm, batcher's algorithm, which requires n/p + ((m+n)/p)log msteps in the general case and km/p + ((k+)/)(m/p)log m in the special case where n=km.cacm october, gavril, f..kparallel processing, parallel merging, parallel binary insertion.c.ca jb january ,   : am
