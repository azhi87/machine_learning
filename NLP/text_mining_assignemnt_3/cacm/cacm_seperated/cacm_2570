a comparison of list schedules for parallel processing systems.wthe problem of scheduling two or more processorsto minimize the execution time of a program which consists of a set of partially ordered tasksis studied.  cases where task execution times are deterministic and others in which execution times arerandom variables are analyzed.  it is shown that different algorithms suggested in the literature vary significantlyin execution time and that the b-schedule of coffman and graham is near-optimal.  a dynamic programmingsolution for the case in which execution times are random variables is presented.cacm december, adam, t. l.chandy, k. m.dickson, j. r..kparallel processing, precedence graphs, scheduling,list scheduling, optimization, dynamic programming.c. . . . . . . . .ca jb january ,   : am
