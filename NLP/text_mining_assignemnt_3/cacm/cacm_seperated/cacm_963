relative effects of central processor and input-outputspeeds upon throughput on the large computer.wpresented in this paper is a technique fordetermining the relative effects of the internal speed of the computer and the speed of the input-outputunits upon the overall speed of the system. equations are derived which permit the determination of theseeffects from hardware usage measurements.cacm december, white, p.ca jb march ,   : pm
