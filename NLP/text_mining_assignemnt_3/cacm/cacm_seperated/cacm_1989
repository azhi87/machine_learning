transition network grammars for natural language analysis.wthe use of augmented transition network grammars for the analysisof natural language sentences is described.  structure-buildingactions associated with the arcs of the grammar network allow for the reordering,restructuring, and copying of constituents necessary to producedeep-structure representations of the type normally obtained from atransformational analysis, and conditions on the arcs allow for apowerful selectivity which can rule out meaningless analyses and takeadvantage of semantic information to guide the parsing.  theadvantage of this model for natural language analysis are discussedin detail and illustrated by examples.  an implementation of anexperimental parsing system for transition network grammars is briefly described.cacm october, woods, w. a..kcomputational linguistics, grammars, grammar models, linguistics,natural language analysis, parsing, semantic interpretation,transition network grammars, transformational grammars.c. .ca jb february ,   : am
