an efficient list-moving algorithm using constant workspace.wan efficient algorithm is presented for movingarbitrary list structures, using no storage (apart from program variables) other than that requiredto hold the original list and the copy.  the original list is destroyed as it is moved.  no markbits are necessary, but pointers to the copy must be distinguishable from pointers to the original.  thealgorithm is superior in execution speed to previous algorithms for the same problem.  some variationsand extensions of the algorithm are discussed.cacm june, clark, d. w..klist moving, list copying, lisp, space complexity, constant workspace.c. . .ca jb january ,   : pm
