experiments with an automatic theorem-proverhavingpartial ordering inference rules.wautomatic theorem-provers need to be made muchmore efficient.  with this in mind, slagle has shown how the axioms for partial ordering can be replacedby built-in inference rules when using a particular theorem-proving algorithm based upon hyper-resolution andparamodulation.  the new rules embody the transitivity of partial orderings and the close relationship between predicates.  a program has been developed using a modified version of these rules.  this new theorem-proverhas been found to be very powerful for solving problems involving partial orderings.  this paper presentsa detailed description of the program and a comprehensive account of the experiments that have been performed with it.cacm november, slagle, j. r.norton, l. m..ktheorem-proving, partial ordering, resolution,hyper-resolution, p-resolution, paramodulation,inference rules, heuristics.c. .ca jb january ,   : am
