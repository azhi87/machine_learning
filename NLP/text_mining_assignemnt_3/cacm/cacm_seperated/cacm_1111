a class of iterative techniques for the factorization of polynomials*.wa method of iteration is developed in termsof a function of somewhat arbitrary character.  sufficient conditions are given for convergence ofthe process, yielding factors of arbitrary degree for polynomials in one variable.  both lin's methodand newton's method occur as special cases.cacm march, luther, h. a.ca jb march ,   : am
