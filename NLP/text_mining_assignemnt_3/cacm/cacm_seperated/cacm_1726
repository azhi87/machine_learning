preliminary investigation of techniquesfor automated reading of unformatted text.wmethods for converting unstructured printedmaterial into computer code are experimentally investigated.  an operator-controlled mode, dependingon human demarcation of the various regions of the page for guiding the scanner, is implemented bymeans of a joystick and a crt display.  this mode, for which some performance figures are obtained, is thoughtto be suitable for processing very complicated material, such as technical journals.  for simpler material,for instance the "claims" sections of patents, and in applications where the utmost accuracy is not necessary,an unsupervised mode is advocated.  here, the textual portions of the page are located duringa rapid prescan by a rudimentary form of frequency analysis.  these areas are then rescanned at a higherresolution suitable for character recognition.  error rates of the order of . percent are obtained ina simple problem involving photographs of telephone company meter boards.  other matters related to thedesign of a general purpose page reader, such as the segmentation of printed text, the possibility oftime-sharing the scanner, interactive man-machine operation, and the facsimile reproduction of illustrations, are discussed.cacm july, nagy, g..kpattern recognition, character recognition, textreading, information retrieval, unformatted text operator-controlled reader, online reader,text-image discrimination, reading machine.c. . . . .ca jb february ,   : pm
