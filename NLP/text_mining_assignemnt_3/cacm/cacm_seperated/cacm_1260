least-squares analysis of resonance spectra on small computers.wthe problem of analyzing data from a mossbauereffect experiment is discussed.  by using the cut step procedure for convergence and by imposing physicalconstraints on the functional form of the calculation it is possible to make the analysis on asmall computer.  the analysis has been carried out on an ibm  computer with a , bcd core memory.cacm may, marshall, s. w.nelson, j. a.wilenzick, r. m.ca jb march ,   : pm
