a comparison of numerical techniques in markov modeling.wthis paper presents several numerical methods whichmay be used to obtain the stationary probability vectors of markovian models.  an example of a nearlydecomposable system is considered, and the results obtained by the different methods examined.  a postmortem reveals why standard techniques often fail to yield the correct results.  finally, a means of estimatingthe error inherent in the decomposition of certain models is presented.cacm february, stewart, w.j..kmarkov models, numerical techniques, simultaneousiteration, near-decomposability.c. . .ca jb march ,   : pm
