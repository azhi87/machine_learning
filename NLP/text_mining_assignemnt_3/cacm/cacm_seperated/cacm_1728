further experimental data on the behaviorof programs in a paging environment.wresults are summarized from an empirical studydirected at the measurement of program operating behavior in those multiprogramming systems in whichprograms are organized into fixed length pages.  the data collected from the interpretive execution ofa number of paged programs are used to describe the frequency of page faults, i.e. the frequency of thoseinstants at which an executing program requires a page of data or instructions not in main (core) memory. these data are used also for the evaluation of page replacement algorithms and for assessing theeffects on performance of changes in the amount of storage allocated to executing programs.cacm july, coffman, e. g.varian, l. c..kpaging systems, paging, dynamic program behavior, programbehavior, virtual memory systems, single-level storage, one-level storage, operating system simulation,operating systems, supervisor simulation, machine language program interpretation.c. . . .ca jb february ,   : pm
