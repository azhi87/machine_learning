toward automatic program synthesis.wan elementary outline of the theorem-provingapproach to automatic program synthesis is given, without dwelling on technical details.  the method isillustrated by the automatic construction of both recursive and iterative programs operating on naturalnumbers,lists, and trees,  in order to construct a program satisfying certain specifications a theoreminduced by those specifications is proved, and the desired program is extracted from the proof.  thesame technique is applied to transform recursively defined functions into iterative programs, frequentlywith a major gain inefficiency.  it is emphasized that in order to construct a program with loops or withrecursion, the principle of mathematical induction must be applied. the relation between the version ofthe induction rule used and the form of the program constructed is explored in some detail.cacm march, manna, z.waldinger, r. j..kartificial intelligence, answer extraction, automaticprogram synthesis, mathematical induction principle, problem solving, theorem proving.c. . .ca jb february ,   : pm
