communicating sequential processes.wthis paper suggests that input and output arebasic primitives of programming and that parallel composition of communicating sequential processes isa fundamental program structuring method.  when combined with a development of dijkstra's guarded command,these concepts are surprisingly versatile.  their use is illustrated by sample solutions ofa variety of familiar programming exercises.cacm august, hoare, c.a.r..kprogramming, programming languages, programming primitives,program structures, parallel programming, concurrency, input, output, guarded commands, nondeterminacy,coroutines, procedures, multiple entries, multiple exits, classes, data representations, recursion,conditional critical regions, monitors, iterative arrays.c. . .ca dh february ,   : am
