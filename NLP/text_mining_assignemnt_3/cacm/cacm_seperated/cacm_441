topological sorting of large networks.wtopological sorting is a procedure requiredfor many problems involving analysis of networks.  an example of one such problem is pert.  the presentpaper presents a very general method for obtaining topological order.  it permits treatment of larger networksthan can be handled on present procedures and achieves this with greater efficiency.  althoughthe procedure can be adapted to any machine, it is discussed in terms of the .  a pert network of, activities can be ordered in less than one hour of machine time.  the method was developed asa byproduct of procedures needed by westinghouse, baltimore.  it has not been programmed and at presentthere are no plans to implement it.  in regard to the techniques described, westinghouse's presentand anticipated needs are completely served by the lockheed program, which is in current use.cacm november, kahn, a. b.ca jb march ,   : pm
