the denotational semantics of programming languages.wthis paper is a tutorial introduction to thetheory of programming language semantics developed by d. scott and c. strachey.  the application of the theoryto formal language specification is demonstrated and other applications are surveyed. the first languageconsidered, loop, is very elementary and its definition merely introduces the notation and methodologyof the approach.  then the semantic conceptsof environments, stores, and continuations are introducedto model classes of programming language features and the underlying mathematical theory of computationdue to scott is motivated and outlined.  finally, the paper presents a formal definition of the language gedanken.cacm august, tennent, r. d..ksemantics, programming language, applicative, imperative,environment, store, continuation, theory of computation, higher-order function, recursive definition, loop, gedanken.c. .ca jb january ,   : am
