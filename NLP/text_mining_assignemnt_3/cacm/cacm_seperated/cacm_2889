performance of height-balanced trees.wthis paper presents the results of simulationsthat investigate the performance of height-balanced (hb[k]) trees.  it is shown that the only statisticof hb[] trees (avl trees) that is a function of the size of the tree is the time to search for an itemin the tree.  for sufficiently large trees, the execution times of all procedures for maintaining hb[]trees are independent of the size of the tree.  in particular, an average of . restructures are requiredper insertion, with an average of . nodes revisited to restore the hb[] property; an average of . restructures are required per deletion, with an average of . nodes revisited to restore the hb[]property.  moreover,the execution times of procedures for maintaining hb[k] trees, for k>, are also independentof the size of the tree except for the average number of nodes revisited on a delete operation inorder to restore the hb[k] property on trace back.  the cost of maintaining hb[k] trees drops sharply as theallowable imbalance (k) increases.  both analytical and experimental results that show the cost of maintaininghb[k] trees as a function of k are discussed.cacm january, karlton, p. l.fuller, s. h.scroggs, r. e.kaehler, e. b..khb[k] trees, balanced trees, avl trees,information storage and retrieval, searching.c. . . . .ca jb january ,   : am
