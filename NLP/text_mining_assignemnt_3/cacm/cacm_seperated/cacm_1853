compact list representation: definition,garbage collection, and system implementation.wcompact lists are stored sequentially in memory,rather than chained with pointers.  since this is not always convenient, the swym system permitsa list to be chained, compact, or any combination of the two.  a description is given of that list representationand the operators implemented (most are similar to those of lisp .).  the system garbage collectorattempts to make all lists compact; it relocates and rearranges all of list storage using temporary storage. this unique list-compacting garbage collection algorithm is presented in detail.  several classes of themacros used to implement the system are described.  finally, consideration is given to those design factorsessential to the success of a plex processing system implementation.cacm september, hansen, w. j..kdata structure, data representation, list structure,list representation, list, compact list, garbage collection, relocation, storage reclamation, macro,primitive list operations, plex processing, plex, pointer, list processing system, lisp, free storage.c. . . . .ca jb february ,   : pm
