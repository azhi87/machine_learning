a practitioner's guide to addressing algorithms.wthis paper consolidates a number of popularrules of thumb which have been suggested for thedesign of record addressing algorithms, and discussesthe applicability of these rules to large commercial databases.  guidelines for selecting identifier transformations,overflow techniques, loading factors, bucket sizes, and loading order and considered.  particularattention is focused on the reasonableness of common heuristics for determining primary or secondarybucket sizes. a mathematical model which explicitly considers storage device characteristics and time/spacecost tradeoffs is used to analyze the effect of design parameters on overall system costs.  aspecific design example is presented and solved.cacm june, severance, d.duhne, r..kdata management, file retrieval, searching, addressingtechniques, hashing functions, synonym resolution, loading factor, bucket size, heuristic design, rules of thumb.c. . . . . . .ca jb january ,   : pm
