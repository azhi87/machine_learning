weighted increment linear search for scatter tables.wa new linear search for hash tables whose incrementstep is a function of the key being addressed is presented.  comparisons with known methods are given,in terms of efficiency and computation complexity.  in particular, the new method applies to tables ofsize n = ^r.  it allows full table searching, and practically eliminates primary clustering at a very low cost.cacm december, luccio, f..klinear search, weighted increment search, scatterstorage, hash table, key, hash address, clustering, search length.c. . .ca jb january ,   : am
