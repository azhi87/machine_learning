pert time calculations without topological ordering.wa simplified technique is presented for perttime calculations without topological ordering.  each event is assigned a unique memory location.  an activityis represented by a link.  a link is defined as a memory location containing the address of anothermemory location.  the time information for an activity is carried with its link.  for a typical net,the majority of activities can be described by one -bit cell each.  the remainder use two -bitcells each.  the links are unidirectional; forward during the t(e) calculation (expected completion time foran activity);backward during the t(l) calculation (time latest allowable for completion of an activity). the calculations progress through the net topologically even though the net is not represented topologically in core.cacm march, lass, s. e.ca jb march ,   : pm
