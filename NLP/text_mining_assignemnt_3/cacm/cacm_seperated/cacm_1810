is automatic "folding" of programs efficient enough to displace manual?.wthe operation of "folding" a program intothe available memory is discussed.  measurements by brown et al. and by nelson on an automatic foldingmechanism of simple design, a demand paging unit built at the ibm research center by belady, nelson,o'neil, and others, permitting its quality to be compared with that of manual folding, are discussed,and it is shown that given some care in use the unit performs satisfactorily under the conditions tested,even though it is operating across a memory-to-storage interface with a very large speed difference.  the disadvantagesof prefolding, which is required when the folding is manual, are examined, and a number ofthe important troubles which beset computing today are shown to arise from, or be aggravated by, thissource.  it is concluded that a folding mechanism will probably become a normal part of most computing systems.cacm december, sayre, d..kpaging, automatic paging, demand paging, folding,automatic folding, storage hierarchies, memory hierarchies, replacement algorithms, performance, measurement.c. . . . .ca jb february ,   : pm
