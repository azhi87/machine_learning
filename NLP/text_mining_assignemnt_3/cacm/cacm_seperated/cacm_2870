a lattice model of secure information flow.wthis paper investigates mechanisms that guaranteesecure information flow in a computer system. these mechanisms are examined within a mathematical frameworksuitable for formulating the requirements of secure information flow among security classes. thecentral component of the model is a lattice structure derived from the security classes and justified by the semanticsof information flow.  the lattice properties permit concise formulations of the security requirementsof different existing systems and facilitate the construction of mechanisms that enforce security. the model provides a unifying view of all systems that restrict information flow, enables a classificationof them according to security objectives, and suggests some new approaches.  it also leads to the constructionof automatic program certification mechanisms for verifying the secure flow of information through a program.cacm may, denning, d. e..kprotection, security, information flow, securityclass, lattice, program certification.c.ca jb january ,   : pm
