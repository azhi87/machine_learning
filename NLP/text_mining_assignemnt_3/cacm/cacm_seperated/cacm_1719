a methodology for calculating andoptimizing real-time system performance.wthe continually increasing size, complexity,number of types, and cost of data processing systems are causing serious re-examination within governmentand industry of the criteria for and methods of calculating and optimizing data processing system costand performance.  real-time data processing systems as typified by the automated airline reservation systemare discussed in this paper.  criteria for evaluating performance are described; a methodology for calculatingand optimizing is outlined; and the method is illustrated by carrying out a portion of the performancecalculation and the optimization of a drum-oriented message switching system.cacm july, stimler, s.brons, k. a..kreal-time system analysis, real-time system design,real-time system performance criteria, real-time system cost performance ratio.c. . . . .ca jb february ,   : am
