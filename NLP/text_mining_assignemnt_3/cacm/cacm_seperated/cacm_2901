an encoding method for multifield sorting and indexing.wsequences of character strings with an orderrelation imposed between sequences are considered.  an encoding scheme is described which produces a single,order-preserving string from a sequence of strings.  the original sequence can be recovered fromthe encoded string, and one sequence of strings precedes another if and only if the encoding of the firstprecedes the encoding of the second.  the strings may be variable length, without a maximum length restriction,and no symbols need be reserved for control purposes.  hence any symbol may occur in any string.  thescheme is useful for multifield sorting, multifield indexing, and other applications where orderingon more than one field is important.cacm november, blasgen, m. w.casey, r. g.eswaran, k. p..ksorting multifield indexes, lexicographic order, searching, encoding.c. . . . .ca jb december ,   : am
