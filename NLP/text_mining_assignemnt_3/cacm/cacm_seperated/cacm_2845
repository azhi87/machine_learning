a buddy system variation for disk storage allocation.wa generalization of the buddy system for storageallocation is described. the set of permitted block sizes {size(i)}, i=,n, must satisfy the conditionsize(i)=size(i-)+size(i-k(i)) where k may be any meaningful integral-valued function.  this makes itpossible to force logical storage blocks to coincide with physical storage blocks, such as tracks and cylinders.cacm july, burton, w..kbuddy system, dynamic storage allocation.c. . .ca jb january ,   : am
