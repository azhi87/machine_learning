secure communications over insecure channels.waccording to traditional conceptions of cryptographicsecurity, it is necessary to transmit a key, by secret means, before encrypted messages canbe sent securely.  this paper shows that it is possible to select a key over open communications channelsin such a fashion that communications security can be maintained.  a method is described which forcesany enemy to expend an amount of work which increases as the square of the work required of the two communicantsto select the key.  the method provides a logically new kind of protection against the passiveeaves dropper.  it suggests that further research on this topic will be highly rewarding, bothin a theoretical and a practical sense.cacm april, merkle, r.c..ksecurity, cryptography, cryptology, communicationssecurity, wiretap, computer network security, passive eavesdropping, key distribution, public key cryptosystem.c. .ca dh february ,   : pm
