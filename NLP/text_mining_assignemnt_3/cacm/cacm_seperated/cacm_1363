a general method of systematic interval computationfor numerical integration of initial value problems.wa procedure is given for continuously computingand monitoring the step size to be used by a self-starting, p-th order numerical integration methodto solve an initial value problem.  the procedure uses an estimate of the truncation error to calculate the step size.cacm october, martin, w. c.paulson, k. c.sashkin, l.ca jb march ,   : pm
