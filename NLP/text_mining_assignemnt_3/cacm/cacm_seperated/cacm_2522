the design, implementation, and evaluation of a working set dispatcher.wthe behavior of a computer system is largelydependent upon the algorithms employed to allocate the system resources to the processes competing for them. recent research in time-sharing paging systems has developed the working set model for program behavior,and are source allocation strategy based on this model has been proposed.  two implementationsalong these principles have been reported, but it seems that in neither case have further results beenannounced.  this report discusses the design and implementation of a dispatcher based on the working setprinciple, presents data to permit analysis of its behavior, and indicates future directions of researchon methods of controlling a computer system.cacm april, rodriguez-rosell, j.dupuy, j. p..kworking set, dispatcher, scheduler, time-sharingsystems, resource allocation, software evaluation, operating systems, supervisory systems.c. .ca jb january ,   : am
