symbolic execution and program testing.wthis paper describes the symbolic execution ofprograms.  instead of supplying the normal inputs to a program (e.g. numbers) one supplies symbols representingarbitrary values.  the execution proceeds as in a normal execution except that values may be symbolicformulas over the input symbols.  the difficult, yet interesting issues arise during the symbolic executionof conditional branch type statements.  a particular system called effigy which provides symbolicexecution for program testing and debugging is also described.  it interpretively executes programs writtenin a simple pl/i style programming language.  it includes many standard debugging features, the abilityto manage and to prove things about symbolic expressions, a simple program testing manager, and a programverifier.  a brief discussion of the relationship between symbolic execution and program proving is also included.cacm july, king, j. c..ksymbolic execution, program testing, program debugging,program proving, program verification, symbolic interpretation.c. . .ca jb january ,   : pm
