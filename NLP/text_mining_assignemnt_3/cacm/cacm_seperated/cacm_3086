on the complexity of computing the measure of u[ai, bi].wthe decision tree complexity of computing themeasure of the union of n (possibly overlapping) intervals is shown to be  (n log n), even if comparisonsbetween linear functions of the interval endpoints are allowed.  the existence of an   (n log n) lower boundto determine whether any two of n real numbers are within   of each other is also demonstrated.  theseproblems provide an excellent opportunity for discussing the effects of the computational model onthe ease of analysis and on the results produced.cacm july, fredman, m.l.weide, b..kanalysis of algorithms, combinatorial problems,computational complexity, computational models, decision tree programs, lower bounds.c. . . .ca dh february ,   : pm
