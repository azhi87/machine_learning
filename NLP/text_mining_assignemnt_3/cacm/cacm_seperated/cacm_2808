the lemniscate constants.wthe lemniscate constants, and indeed someof the methods used for actually computing them, have played an enormous part in the development ofmathematics.  an account is given here of some of the methods used-most of the derivations can be madeby elementary methods.  this material can be used for teaching purposes, and there is much relevant andinteresting historical material.  the acceleration methods developed for the purpose of evaluatingthese constants are useful in other problems.cacm january, todd, j..klemniscate, acceleration, elliptic functions, euler transformation.c. .ca jb january ,   : am
