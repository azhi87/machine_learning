an analysis of inline substitution for a structured programming language.wan optimization technique known as inline substitutionis analyzed.  the optimization consists of replacing a procedure invocation by a modified copyof the procedure body.  the general problem of using inline substitution to minimize execution timesubject to size constrain ts is formulated, and an approximate algorithmic solution is proposed.  the algorithmdepends on run-time statistics about the program to be optimized.  preliminary results for theclu structured programming language indicate that, in programs with a low degree of recursion, over percent of all procedure calls can be eliminated, with little increase in the size of compiled code and asmall savings in execution time.  other conclusions based on these results are also presented.cacm september, scheifler, r. w..kinline substitution, open coding, open compilation,program optimization, compilers, structured programming languages, run-time statistics.c.ca jb december ,   : pm
