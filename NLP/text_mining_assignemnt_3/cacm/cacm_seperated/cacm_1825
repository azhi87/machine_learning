a practical method for constructing lr(k) processors.wa practical method for constructing lr(k) processorsis developed.  these processors are capable of recognizing and parsing an input during a singleno-backup scan in a number of steps equal to the length of the input plus the number of steps in itsderivation.  the technique presented here is based on the original method described by knuth, but decreasesboth the effort required to construct the processor and the size of the processor produced.  this procedureinvolves partitioning the given grammar into a number of smaller parts.  if an lr(k) processor can beconstructed for each part (using knuth's algorithm) and if certain conditions relating these individualprocessors are satisfied, then an lr(k) processor for the entire grammar can be constructed for them. using this procedure, an lr() parser for algol has been obtained.cacm november, korenjak, a. j..klr(k) grammar, syntactic analysis, parser, deterministiclanguage, syntax-directed compiler, languageprocessor, context-free language algol.c. . .ca jb february ,   : pm
