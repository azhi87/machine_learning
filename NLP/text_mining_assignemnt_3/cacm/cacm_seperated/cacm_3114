a technique for isolating differences between files.wa simple algorithm is described for isolatingthe differences between two files.  one application is the comparing of two versions of a source programor other file in order to display all differences.  the algorithm isolates differences in a way that correspondsclosely to our intuitive notion of difference, is easy to implement, and is computationally efficient,with time linear in the file length.  for most applications the algorithm isolates differences similarto those isolated by the longest common subsequence.  another application of this algorithm merges filescontaining independently generated changes into a single file.  the algorithm can also be used to generateefficient encodings of a file in the form of the differences between itself and a given "datum" file,permitting reconstruction of the original file from the difference and datum files.   cacm april, heckel, p..kdifference isolation, word processing, text editing,program maintenance, hash coding, file compression, bandwidth compression, longest common subsequence,file comparison, molecular evolution.c. . . .ca dh february ,   : am
