a statistical study of the accuracy of floating point number systems.wthis paper presents the statistical resultsof tests of the accuracy of certain arithmetic systems in evaluating sums, products and inner products,and analytic error estimates for some of the computations.  the arithmetic systems studied are -digithexadecimal and -digit binary floating point number representations combined with the usual chopand round modes of arithmetic with various numbers of guard digits, and with a modified round mode with guarddigits.  in a certain sense, arithmetic systems differing only in their use of binary or hexadecimal numberrepresentations are shown to be approximately statistically equivalent inaccuracy.  further, theusual round mode with guard digits is shown to be statistically superior in accuracy to the usual chopmode in all cases save one.  the modified round mode is found to be superior to the chop mode in all cases.cacm april, kuki, h.cody, w. j..kerror analysis, floating point arithmetic,rounding, guard digits, number representation.c. . .ca jb january ,   : am
