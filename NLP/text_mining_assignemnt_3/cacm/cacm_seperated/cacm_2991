improving the access time for random access files.wclustering in the key set is decreased bysmoothing the key-to-address transformation, and by adding shadow buckets to an open chaining file.  thekeys are pre-hashed before the address division, to remove the effect of sequential properties in thekey set.  shadow buckets in the key search sequence reduce the effect of nonuniformity in file loading,and decrease the number of maximum probes needed to locate a record.  the combined effects of these techniqueslead to improved file performance for secondary storage devices, as shown by empirical studies.cacm march, clapson, p..khashing, hashing techniques, hashing methods, hashcoding, keys, key transformation, key-to-address transformation, direct addressing, direct access, directaccess method, randomizing, random access, file addressing, file organizations, file structures, scatterstorage, search method, collisions, synonyms, clustering, information retrieval, open addressing, openchaining, buckets, bucket size, shadow buckets, combinatorics.c. . . . . .ca jb december ,   : am
