organizing matrices and matrix operations for paged memory systems.wmatrix representations and operations are examinedfor the purpose of minimizing the page faulting occurring in a paged memory system.  it is shown thatcarefully designed matrix algorithms can lead to enormous savings in the number of page faults occurringwhen only a small part of the total matrix can be in main memory at one time.  examination of addition,multiplication, and inversion algorithms shows that a partitioned matrix representation (i.e. one submatrixor partition per page) in most cases induced fewer page faults than a row-by-row representation. the number of page-pulls required by these matrix manipulation algorithms is also studied as a functionof the number of pages of main memory available to the algorithm.cacm march, mckellar, a. c.coffman jr., e. g..kmatrix algorithms, array processing, paging algorithms,paged memory systems, virtual memory systems, array storage allocation, storage allocation.c. . .ca jb february ,   : am
