sitar: an interactive text processing system for small computers.wsitar, a low-cost in teractive text handlingand text analysis system for nontechnical users, is in many ways comparable to in teractive bibliographicalsearch and retrieval systems, but has several additional features. it is implemented on a pdp/ time-sharingcomputer invoked by a crt with microprogrammed editing functions.  it uses a simple command language designatinga function, a file, and a search template consisting of the textual string desired and stringsdelimiting the context in which the hit is to be delivered.  extensive experience with sitar shows thatthe combined powers of simple commands, string orientation, circular file structure, a crt with localmemory, and conversational computing produce a system much more powerful than the sum of its parts.cacm july, schneider, b. r. jr.watts, r. m..kinformation retrieval, text editing, minicomputers,crts,time sharing, bibliographic search and retrieval, literary analysis, linguistic analysis, command languages.c. .ca jb december ,   : am
