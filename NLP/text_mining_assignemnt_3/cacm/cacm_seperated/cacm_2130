automatic segmentation of cyclic program structuresbased on connectivity and processor timing.wtime-shared, multiprogrammed, and overlayed batch systems frequentlyrequire segmentation of computer programs into discrete portions.  these program portions are transferred between executable andperipheral storage whenever necessary; segmentation of programs in a manner that  reduces the frequency of such transfers is thesubject of this paper.  segmentation techniques proposed by c. v.ramamoorthy are subject to limitations that arise when the preferredsegment size is not compatible with the physical restrictionsimposed by the available computing equipment.  a generalization oframamoorthy's suggestions is made in order to allow their application when circumstances are other than ideal.cacm january, lowe, t. c..kautomatic segmentation, cyclic program structures, loops, paging, multiprogramming, loaders, assemblers, compilers, time-sharing, program connectivity.c. . .ca jb february , , : pm
