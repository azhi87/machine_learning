simple lr(k) grammars.wa class of context-free grammars, called the"simple lr(k)" or slr(k) grammars is defined.  this class has been shown to include weak precedenceand simple precedence grammars as proper subsets.  how to construct parsers for the slr(k) grammars isalso shown.  these parser-construction techniques are extendible to cover all of the lr(k) grammars ofknuth; they have been implemented and by direct comparison proved to be superior to precedence techniques,not only in the range of grammars covered, but also in the speed of parser construction andin the size and speed of the resulting parsers.cacm july, deremer, f. l..kcontext-free grammar, lr(k) grammar, precedencegrammar, syntactic analysis, parsing algorithm, parser, finite-state machine, deterministic pushdown automaton.c. . .ca jb february ,   : am
