the multics virtual memory: concepts and design.was experience with use of on-line operatingsystems has grown, the need to share information among system users has become increasingly apparent. many contemporary systems permit some degree of sharing.  usually, sharing is accomplished by allowingseveral users to share data via input and output of information stored in files kept in secondary storage. through the use of segmentation, however, multics provides direct hardware addressing by user andsystem programs of all information, independent of its physical storage location.  information is storedin segments each of which is potentially sharable and carries its own independent attributes of size and accessprivilege.  here, the design and implementation considerations of segmentation and sharing in multicsare first discussed under the assumption that all information resides in large, segmented main memory. since the size of main memory on contemporary systems is rather limited, it is then shown how the multicssoftware achieves the effect of a large segmented main memory through the use of the honeywell segmentation and paging hardware.cacm may, bensoussan, a.clingen, c. t.daley, r. c..koperating system, multics, virtual memory, segmentation,information sharing, paging, memory management, memory hierarchy.c. . .ca jb january ,   : am
