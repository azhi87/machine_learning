synthesizing constraint expressions.wa constraint network representation is presentedfor a combinatorial search problem: finding values for a set of variables subject to a set of constraints. a theory of consistency levels in such networks is formulated, which is related to problemsof backtrack tree search efficiency.  an algorithm is developed that can achieve any level of consistencydesired, in order to preprocess the problem for subsequent backtrack search, or to function as an alternativeto backtrack search by explicitly determining all solutions.cacm november, freuder, e.c..kbacktrack, combinatorial algorithms, constraintnetworks, constraint satisfaction, graph coloring, network consistency, relaxation, scene labeling, search.c. . . . .ca dh january ,   : pm
