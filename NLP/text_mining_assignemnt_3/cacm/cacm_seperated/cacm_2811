structural pattern recognition of carotid pulsewaves using a general waveform parsing system.wa general waveform parsing system with applicationto structural pattern recognition of carotid pulse waves is described.  the carotid arterial pulsewave is of medical importance because of variation in its structure induced by arterial aging and cardiovasculardisease.  the syntax-driven waveform analysis system has been applied with good results to these pulsewaves to detect and measure structural variations.  the waveform parsing system is modeled on a compiler-compilersystem and allows the user to enter application specific information as data.  it is thus generalenough to be applicable to other waveforms.cacm december, stockman, g.kanal, l.kyle, m. c..kstructural pattern recognition, parsing, waveform analysis, pulse waves.c. . . .ca jb january ,   : pm
