characteristics of application software maintenance.wmaintenance and enhancement of applicationsoftware consume a major portion of the total life cycle cost of a system.  rough estimates of the totalsystems and programming resources consumed range as high as - percent in each category.  however,the area has been given little attention in the literature.  to analyze the problems in this area aquestionnaire was developed and pretested.  it was then submitted to  organizations.  respondents totaled.  responses were analyzed with the spss statistical package.  the results of the analysis indicatethat: () maintenance and enhancement do consume much of the total resources of systems and programminggroups; () maintenance and enhancement tend to be viewed by management as at least somewhat more importantthan new application software development; () in maintenance and enhancement, problems of a managementorientation tend to be more significant than those of a technical orientation; and () userdemands for enhancements and extension constitute the most important management problem area.cacm june, lientz, b.p.swanson, e.b.tompkins, g.e..ksoftware maintenance, use of productivityaids, management and technical issues .c. .ca dh february ,   : am
