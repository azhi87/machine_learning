program development by stepwise refinement.wthe creative activity of programming-to be distinguishedfrom coding-is usually taught by examples serving to exhibit certain techniques.  it is here consideredas a sequence of design decisions concerning the decomposition of tasks into subtasks and of datainto data structures.  the process of successive refinement of specifications is illustrated by a shortbut nontrivial example, from which a number of conclusions are drawn regarding the art and the instruction of programming.cacm april, wirth, n..keducation in programming, programmingtechniques, stepwise program construction.c. .ca jb february ,   : pm
