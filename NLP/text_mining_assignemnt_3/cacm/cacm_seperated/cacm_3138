a mathematical programming updating method using modifiedgivens transformations and applied to lp problems.wan efficient and numerically stable method is presented for the problem ofupdating an orthogonal decomposition of a matrix of column (or row) vectors.the fundamental idea is to add a column (or row) analogousto adding an additional row of data in a linear least squares problem.a column (or row) is dropped by a formal scaling with theimaginary unit,  -, followed by least squares addition of the column(or row).  the elimination process for the procedure is successivessive application of the givens transformation in modified (more efficient)form.  these ideas are illustrated with an implementationof the revised simplex method.  the algorithm is a general purposeone that does not account for any particular structure or sparsityin the equations.  some suggested computational tests for determiningsigns of various controlling parameters in the revised simplexalgorithm are mentioned.  a simple means of constructingtest cases and some sample computing times are presented. cacm april, hanson, r.j.wisniewski, j.a..klinear programming, numerical linear algebra, modified givens transformations,linear programming test cases.c . . . .ca dh may ,   : pm
