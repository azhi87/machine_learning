compressed tries.wthis paper presents a new data structure,called a compressed trie or c-trie, to be used in information retrieval systems.  it has the same underlyingm-ary tree structure as a trie, where m is a parameter of the trie, but whereas the fields of thenodes in a trie have to be large enough to hold a key or at least a pointer, the fields in a c-trie areonly one bit long.  in the analysis part of the paper it will be shown that for a collection of n keys theretrieval time, measured in terms of bit inspections of one key, is of the order logm(n) and the storagerequirement of the order n*(m+log n) bits.  this improvement in storage requirements and retrieval timeis achieved at the cost of decreasing the flexibility of the structure, and therefore updating costs are increased. first the c-trie is analyzed as a data structure, and then several methods of its usefor relatively static databases are discussed.cacm july, maly, k..kdata structure, database, m-ary tree, trie,retrieval time, storage requirement, keys.c. . .ca jb january ,   : pm
