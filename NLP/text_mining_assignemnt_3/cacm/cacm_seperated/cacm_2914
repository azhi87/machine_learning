use of the lru stack depth distributionfor simulation of paging behavior.wtwo families of probability distributions wereneeded for use by a virtual memory simulation model: headway between page fault distributions, andworking set size distributions.  all members of both families can be derived from the lru stack depth distribution. simple expressions for the computation of both kinds of distributions are given.  finally, examplesare given of both families of distributions as computed from a published stack depth distribution.cacm november, turner, r.strecker, b..kvirtual memory, paging, lru stack, working set, headwaybetween page faults, computer system simulation.c. . .ca jb december ,   : am
