information theory applied to the conversionof decision tables to computer programs.wusing ideas from information theory, this paperdevelops a heuristic algorithm that converts a limited entry decision table to a tree structured computerprogram with near minimum average processing time.  the method is applicable to any limited entrydecision table and does not require that actions have single rules or that the cost of testing conditionsbe equal.  it is thus more general than the previously published heuristic algorithms.  comparedto the optimal algorithm of reinwald and soland, this algorithm is easy to code and takes a much smallertranslation time; it is thus felt that it is more useful in practice.  the algorithm is well suited formanual conversion of decision tables to flowcharts.cacm september, ganapathy, s.rajaraman, v..kdecision tables, optimum computer programs, information measure.c. . .ca jb january ,   : am
