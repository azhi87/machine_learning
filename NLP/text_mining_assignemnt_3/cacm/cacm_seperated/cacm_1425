flow diagrams, turing machines andlanguages with only two formation rules.win the first part of the paper, flow diagramsare introduced to represent inter al. mappings of a set into itself.  although not every diagram isdecomposable into a finite number of given base diagrams, this becomes true at a semantical level dueto a suitable extension of the given set and of the basic mappings defined in it.  two normalizationmethods of flow diagrams are given.  the first has three base diagrams; the second, only two.  in the secondpart of the paper, the second method is applied to the theory of turing machines.  with every turingmachine provided with a two-way half-tape, there is associated a similar machine, doing essentiallythe same job, but working on a tape obtained from the first one by interspersing alternate blank squares. the new machine belongs to the family, elsewhere introduced, generated by composition and iteration fromthe two machines l and r.  that family is a proper subfamily of the whole family of turing machines.cacm may, bohm, c.jacopini, g.ca jb march ,   : am
