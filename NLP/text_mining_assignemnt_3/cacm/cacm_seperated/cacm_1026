divide-and-correct methods for multiple precision division.wa division problem is defined and notationto relate it to the problem of multiple precision operation in a digital computer is introduced.  a basicdivide-and-correct method for multiple precision division is formulated and its known properties brieflyreviewed.  of particular interest is the fact that the method produces at each step a set of preciselythree estimates for the desired result, one of which is exact.cacm august, stein, m. l.ca jb march ,   : pm
