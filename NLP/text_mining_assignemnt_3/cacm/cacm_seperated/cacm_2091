pdel-a language for partial differential equations.wconventional computer methods available to solvecontinuous system problems characterized by partialdifferential equations are very time-consuming and cumbersome.  aconvenient, easy to learn and to use, high level problem orientedlanguage to solve and study partial differential equation problemshas been designed; a practical translator for the language has alsobeen designed, and a working version of it has been constructedfor a significant portion of the language.  this partial differentialequation language, pdel, is outlined, and the highlightsof the translator are briefly summarized.cacm march, cardenas, a. f.karplus, w. j..kproblem oriented or digital simulation language,partial differential equations, translator,pl/, preprocessor pl/, finite difference algorithms.c. . . .ca jb february ,   : pm
