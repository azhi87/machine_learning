a weighted buddy method for dynamic storage allocation.wan extension of the buddy method, called the weightedbuddy method, for dynamic storage allocation is presented.  the weighted buddy method allows blocksizes of ^k and (^k), whereas the original buddy method allowed only block sizes of ^k. this extensionis achieved at an additional cost of only two bits per block.  simulation results are presented whichcompare this method with the buddy method.  these results indicate that for a uniform request distribution,the buddy system has less total memory fragmentation than the weighted buddy algorithm.  however, the totalfragmentation is smaller for the weighted buddy method when the requests are for exponentially distributed block sizes.cacm october, shen, k. k.peterson, j. l..kweighted buddy algorithm, buddy systems,memory allocation, dynamic storage allocation.c. . .ca jb january ,   : pm
