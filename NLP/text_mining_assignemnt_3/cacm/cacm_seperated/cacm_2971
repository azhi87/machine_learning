sp/k: a system for teaching computer programming.wsp/k is a compatible subset of the pl/i  languagethat has been designed for teaching programming. the features of the sp/k language were chosen to encouragestructured problem solving by computers, to make the language easy to learn and use, to eliminateconfusing and redundant constructs, and to make the language easy to compile.  the resulting languageis suitable for in troducing programming concepts used in various applications, including business dataprocessing, scientific calculations and non-numeric computation.  sp/k is actually a sequence of languagesubsets called sp/, sp/,...sp/.  each subset in troduces new programming language constructs whileretaining all the constructs of preceding subsets. each subset is precisely defined and can be learnedor implemented without the following subsets.cacm may, holt, r. c.wortman, d. b.barnard, d. t.cordy, j. r..kprogrammer education, universities, community colleges,high schools, pl/i, sp/k, minicomputers, programming language design, teaching programming, in troductory computing.c. . . .ca jb december ,   : am
