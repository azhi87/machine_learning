a method for incrementally compilinglanguages with nested statement structure.wa method of incremental compilation is presentedwhich applies especially to programming languages in which statements can be nested (such as algol andpl/i).  the method permits editing of the source language using a general purpose text editor, and incrementalprocessing of changes without frequent recompilation of entire routines.  the essential pointsof the method are: () the syntax of the language is restricted insof ar as which constructs may occuron lines; () an internal data structure (called the skeleton) is maintained to represent the statementstructure; () the recompilation is partially batched in the sense that recompilation of modified linesdoes not occur until the last of a set of editing commands has been received; and () the parsing andcompilation are factored into two parts, that done on individual lines and that done globally tohandle the relationships between the lines.cacm december, earley, j.caizergues, p..kincremental compiler, interactive programming language .c. .ca jb january ,   : pm
