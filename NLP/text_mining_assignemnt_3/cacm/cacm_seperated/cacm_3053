packed scatter tables.wscatter tables for open addressing benefitfrom recursive entry displacements, cutoffs for unsuccessful searches, and auxiliary cost functions.  comparedwith conventional methods, the new techniques provide substantially improved tables that resemble exact-solutionoptimal packings.  the displacements are depth-limited approximations to an enumerative(exhaustive) optimization, although packing costs remain linear-o(n)-with table size n.  the techniques areprimarily suited for important fixed (but possibly quite large) tables for which reference frequencies maybe known: op-code tables,spelling dictionaries, access arrays.  introduction of frequency weights furtherimproves retrievals, but the enhancement may degrade cutoffs.  cacm october, lyon, g..kassignment problem, backtrack programming, hashing, openaddressing, recursion, scatter table rearrangements .c. .ca dh january ,   : pm
