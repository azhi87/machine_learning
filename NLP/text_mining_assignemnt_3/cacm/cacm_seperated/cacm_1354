conversion of decision tables to computerprograms by rule mark techniques.wthe rule mask technique is one method of convertinglimited entry decision tables to computer programs.  recent discussion suggest that in many circumstancesit is to be preferred to the technique of constructing networks or trees.  a drawback of thetechnique as hitherto presented is its liability to produce object programs of longer run time than necessary. in this paper a modification of the technique is discussed which takes into account both rule frequenciesand the relative times for evaluating conditions.  this can materially improve object program run time.cacm november, king, p. j. h.ca jb march ,   : pm
