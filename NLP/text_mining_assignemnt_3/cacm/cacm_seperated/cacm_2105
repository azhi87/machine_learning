an interactive computer system using graphical flowchart input.wan interactive computer system operational on a graphical computer terminal is described.  this system was designed to demonstrate a method of programming by computer interpretation of a flowchart.  the user draws a description of asampled-data system and specifies description is transmitted to a largescale computer.  the design is simulated, and a graphic representation of the processed signal is returned to the scope.  a successful design may require numerous modifications of the original design.  a graphical interactive system provides an environment to perform this iterative process efficiently and effectively.cacm february, robins, m. f.beyer, j. d..ksimulation program, graphical input-output sampled data systems.c. .ca jb february ,   : am
