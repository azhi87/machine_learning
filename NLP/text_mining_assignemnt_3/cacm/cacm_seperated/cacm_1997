increasing the efficiency of quicksort.wa method is presented for the analysis of various generalizations ofquicksort.  the average asymptotic number of comparisons needed is shown to be an log^(n).  a formula is derived expressing a in terms ofthe probability distribution of the "bound" of a partition.  this formula assumes a particularly simple form for a generalization alreadyconsidered by hoare, namely, choice of the bound as medianof a random sample. the main contribution of this paper is anothergeneralization of quicksort, which uses a bounding interval insteadof a single element as bound.  this generalization turns out tobe easy to implement in a computer program.  a numerical approximationshows that a = . for this version of quicksort compared with. for the original.  this implies a decrease in number of comparisons of  percent; actual tests showed about  percent saving in computing time.cacm september, van emden, m. h..ksorting, quicksort, information content, entropy, distribution of median.c. . . .ca jb february ,   : am
