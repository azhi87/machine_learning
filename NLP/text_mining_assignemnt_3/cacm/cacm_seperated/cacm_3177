how to share a secret.win this paper we show how to divide data d inton pieces in such a way that d is easily reconstructable from anyk pieces, but even complete knowledge of k -  pieces revealsolutely no information about d.  this technique enables the constructionof robust key management schemes for cryptographic systemsthat can function securely and reliably even when misfortunes destroyhalf the pieces and security breaches expose all but one of theremaining pieces.cacm november, shamir, a..kcryptography, key management, interpolation.c. .ca db january ,   : am
