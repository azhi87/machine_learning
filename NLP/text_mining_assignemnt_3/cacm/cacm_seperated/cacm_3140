social processes and proofs of theorems and programs.wit is argued that formal verifications ofprograms, no matter how obtained, will not play thesame key role in the development of computer science and softwareengineering as proofs do in mathematics.  furthermore the absenceof continuity, the inevitability of change, and the complexity ofspecification of significantly many real programs make the formal verification process difficult to justify and manage.  it is feltthat ease of formal verification should not dominate programlanguage design.cacm may, de millo, r.a.lipton, r.j.perlis, a.j..kformal mathematics, mathematical proofs,program verification, program specification.c. . .ca dh june ,   : pm
