syntax-directed documentation for pl .wthe language pl , together with its phrase structure grammar, is used as a concrete basis for illustrating an idea called syntax-directed documentation. this idea is () to use the phrase structure of a program to define the structure of a formal documentation for that program; () to use the syntactic types and identifiers in the resulting structure to trigger the automaticformation of questions to the programmer, whose answers willbecome part of that documentation; and () to provide automatic storageand retrieval facilities so that other programmers who wantto understand or modify the program can access the resulting documentation,which is cross-indexed in various ways by syntactic typesand objects.  a small pl  program, already foundin the literature, is worked out as an example.cacm april, mills, h. d..kdocumentation, syntax analysis, pl , enforced documentation,indexed documentation, automatic interrogation,phase structured grammar, syntax-directed documentation, syntax processing.c. . . .ca jb february ,   : pm
