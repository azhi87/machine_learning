a new uniform pseudorandom number generator.wa new multiplicative congruential pseudorandomnumber generator is discussed, in which the modulus is the largest prime within accumulator capacityand the multiplier is a primitive root of that prime.  this generator passes the usual statisticaltests and in addition the least significant bits appear to be as random as the most significant bits-aproperty which generators having modulus ^k do not possess.cacm june, hutchinson, d. w.ca jb march ,   : am
