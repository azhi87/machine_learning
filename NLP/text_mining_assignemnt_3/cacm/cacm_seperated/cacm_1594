an algorithm for generating permutations.wan algorithm is described which under repeatedapplication generates all permutations of k elements.  only the previously generated permutation,the constant k, and a temporary index are needed.  starting with a particular ordering of k elements (abcd),repeated application of the algorithm will generate k- additional permutations by k- successiverotations.  from the initial circular ordering of k objects, another circular ordering can be obtainedby rotating the k- lowest elements.  for each new k- circular ordering, another k- can be obtainedby rotating the k- lowest elements.  by continuing in this manner, applications of the algorithm will generateall (k-)! circular orderings, or since each circular ordering yields k permutations thealgorithm generates all k! permutations.cacm may, langdon jr., g. g.ca jb february , : am
