inductive methodsfor proving properties of programs.wthere are two main purposes in this paper:first, clarification and extension of known results about computation of recursive programs, with emphasison the difference between the theoretical and practical approaches; second, presentation and examinationof various known methods for proving properties of recursive programs.  discussed in detail are twopowerful inductive methods computational induction and structural induction, including examples of their applications.cacm august, manna, z.nes, s.vuillemin, j..krecursive programs, least fixed point, computationalinduction, structural induction.c. . .ca jb january ,   : am
