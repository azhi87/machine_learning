a comparison of error improvement estimatesfor adaptive trapezoid integration.wvarious simple choices of error improvement estimates for the trapezoidrule are studied to demonstrate a comparison procedure which isrelatively independent of the profusion of adaptive search and stoppingstrategies.  comparisons are based on x^r, `; the inclusionof the noninteger powers makes this more realistic than the usual polynomialbased comparison.  behavior near the singularity was foundto be the dominant factor, and a new estimate, based on a constantcurvature assumption and parametric differences, was consideredslightly better than the other choices considered.cacm march, schweikert, d. g..kadaptive integration, error improvement estimate,trapezoid rule, nonpolynomial error criteria.c.ca jb february ,   : pm
