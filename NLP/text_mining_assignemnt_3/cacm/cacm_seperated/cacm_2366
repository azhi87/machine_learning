complex gamma function with error control.wan algorithm to compute the gamma function andlog gamma function of a complex variable is presented.  the standard algorithm is modified in several respectsto insure the continuity of the function value and to reduce accumulation of round-off errors.  inaddition to computation of function values, this algorithm includes an object-time estimation of round-offerrors.  experimental data with regard to the effectiveness of this error control are presented. a fortran program for the algorithm appears in the algorithms section of this issue.cacm april, kuki, h..kcomplex gamma function, gamma function, complexlog gamma function, loggamma function, round-off error control, inherent error control, run-time error estimates, error estimates.c. .ca jb january ,   : pm
