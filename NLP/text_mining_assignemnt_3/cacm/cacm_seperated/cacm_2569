computer generation of gamma random variateswith non-integral shape parameters.wwhen the shape parameter, a, is integral,generating gamma random variables with a digital computer is straightforward.  there is no simple methodfor generating gamma random variates with non-integral shape parameters.  a common procedure is to approximatelygenerate such random variables by use of the so-called probability switch method.  another procedure,which is exact, is due to johnk.  this paper presents a rejection method for exactly generatinggamma random variables when a is greater than .  the efficiency of the rejection method is shown tobe better than the efficiency of johnk's method.  the paper concludes that when a is non-integral the followingmix of procedures yields the best combination of accuracy and efficiency: () when a is less than, use johnk's method; () when  is less than a and a is less than , use the rejection method; () whena is greater than , use the probability switch method.cacm december,wallace, n. d..ksimulation, gamma random variables,probability distribution, random numbers.c. .ca jb january ,   : am
