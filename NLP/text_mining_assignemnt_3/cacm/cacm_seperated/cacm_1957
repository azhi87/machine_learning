the list set generator: a construct for evaluating set expressions.wthe list set generator is defined and algorithmsfor its use are given.  the list set generator isa construct which may be added to a list processing system or anysystem that handles sets.  it efficiently generates the set whichresults from any expression involving sets and set operators.  theefficiency derives from evaluating the expression as a whole andin parallel, rather than evaluating subexpressions andthen using those sets to arrive at the final result.cacm december, shapiro, s. c..kset manipulating, list processing, setgeneration, sets, lists, file processing.c. . .ca jb february ,   : pm
