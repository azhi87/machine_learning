a syntactic algorithm for peak detectionin waveforms with applications to cardiography.wpeaks in a digitized waveform are detected by analgorithm incorporating piecewise linear approximation and tabular parsing techniques.  several parameters serveto identify the waveform context enabling accurate measurement of peak amplitude, duration, and shape.  thealgorithm is of sufficient speed to allow on-line real-time processing.  an example of its applicationis demonstrated on an electrocardiogram.cacm may, horowitz, s. l..kpeak detection, digitized waveform, piecewise linearapproximation, context-free grammar, bottom-up parsing, electrocardiogram..c. . . . . . .ca jb january ,   : pm
