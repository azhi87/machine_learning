a precise numerical analysis program.wa description is given of a program for computingthe solution to a small number of standard numerical analysis problems to any specified accuracy,up to a limit of  correct decimal places.  each computed number is bounded in an interval with amultiple precision midpoint.  arithmetic operations involving these numbers are executed according to intervalarithmetic concepts, with non-significant digits automatically discarded.  details are suppliedof problem specification and problem computation.cacm september,  aberth, o..kinterval arithmetic, multiple precision, list structure, error control.c. . . . . .ca jb january ,   : am
