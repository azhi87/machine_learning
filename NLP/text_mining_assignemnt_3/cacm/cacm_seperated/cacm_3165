approximation of polygonal maps by cellular maps.wthe approximation of polygonal thematic maps by cellularmaps, an important operation in geographical data processing,is analyzed.  the data organization used for representing the polygonalmaps is a widely used segment-based data structure, where classlabels identify the regions bordering each segment on either side.the approximation algorithm presented operates on such anorganization, eliminating the need for the recognition of region boundaries.each segment is examined only once.  the versatility ofthe new organization is further illustrated by the outline of algorithmsfor area computation and point inclusion.  the algorithm isapplied to a set of soil maps converted to computer-readableform by means of a coordinate digitizer.cacm september, nagy, g.wagle, s.g..kpolygon maps, cellularization, gridding, geographic data structures,computational geometry, computer cartography, automated cartography.c. . .ca db january ,   : pm
