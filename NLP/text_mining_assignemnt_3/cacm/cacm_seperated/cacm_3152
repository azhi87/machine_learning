storage reorganization techniques formatrix computation in a paging environment.win order to multiply matrices while minimizingthe number of page fetches required, it is often more efficient toreorganize the data into submatrix form and to use block multiplication rather than to use the best known algorithms which leave thematrices stored in row-(or column-)oriented form.  an efficientmethod for accomplishing this reorganization is given.  this alsomakes possible the derivation of an asymptotically better boundfor multiplication of matrices given in row-oriented form by adaptingthe technique of strassen to the reorganized data.  the reorganization/block multiplication scheme is shown to be advantageous formatrices and pages of realistic size; the strassen adaptation isnot.  the former scheme is also shown to be advantageous even ifthe transpose of one of the matrices is available at no additional cost.cacm july, fischer, p.c.probert, r.l..kmatrix multiplication, paging, virtual memory,data reorganization, pagination, transpose..c. . .ca dh august ,   : pm
