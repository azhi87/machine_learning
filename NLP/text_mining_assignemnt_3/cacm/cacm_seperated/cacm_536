nonlinear regression and the solution of simultaneous equations.wif one has a set of observables (z,...,zm) whichare bound in a relation with certain parameters (a,...,an) by an equation s(z,...;a,...)=, one frequentlyhas the problem of determining a set of values of the ai which minimizes the sum of squares ofdifferences between observed and calculated values of a distinguished observable, say zm.  if the solutionof the above equation for zm,  zm=n(z,...;a,...) gives rise to a function n which is nonlinear in the ai,then one may rely on a version of gaussian regression [,] for an iteration scheme that converges to a minimizingset of values.  it is shown here that this same minimization technique may be used for the solutionof simultaneous (not necessarily linear) equations.cacm july, baer, r. m.ca jb march ,   : pm
