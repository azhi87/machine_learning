fast parallel sorting algorithms.wa parallel bucket-sort algorithm is presentedthat requires time o(log n) and the use of n processors.  the algorithm makes use of a technique thatrequires more space than the product of processors and time.  a realistic model is used model is used in whichno memory contention is permitted.  a procedure is also presented to sort n numbers in time o(k logn) using n  + /k processors, for k an arbitrary integer.  the model of computation for this procedurepermits simultaneous fetches from the same memory location.cacm august, hirschberg, d.s..kparallel processing, sorting, algorithms, bucket sort.c. . . .ca dh february ,   : am
