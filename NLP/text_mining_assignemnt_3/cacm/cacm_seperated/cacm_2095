measurements of segment size.wdistributions of segment sizes measured under routine operating conditions on a computer system which utilizes variable sized segments(the burroughs b) are discussed.  the most striking featureof the measurements is the large number of small segments-about percent of the segments in use contain less than  words.  althoughthe results are certainly not installation independent, and although they are particularly influenced by features of the b algol system, they should be relevant to the design of new computer systems,especially with respect to the organization of paging schemes.cacm march, batson, a.ju, s.wood, d. c..kstorage allocation, segmentation, segment sizes, page sizes,paging, resource allocation, memory allocation, core utilization.c. . . .ca jb february ,   : pm
