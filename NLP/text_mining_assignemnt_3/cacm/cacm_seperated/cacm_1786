an improved hash code for scatter storage.wintroduced is a hash coding method based onfixed-point division rather than multiplication or logical operations.  this new method allows thehash table to have almost any length.  also a new method of handling collisions is discussed.  known asquadratic search, this method is faster than random search and free from the "clusters" that build up with a linear search.cacm january, maurer, w. d..khash code, hash table, scatter storage, searching .c. . . .ca jb february ,   : pm
