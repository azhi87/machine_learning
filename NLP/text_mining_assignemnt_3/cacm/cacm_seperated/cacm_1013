final examination scheduling.wa method for scheduling final examinationsto yield a minimal number of student conflicts is described.  the "minimization" is achieved by repetitivelyevaluating a nonlinear set of equations.  imbeded in the process is a random or monte carlo selectionof assignments.  as in such heuristic techniques, the solution may not be optimum and many solutionsmay be found which yield locally minimal results.  computer programs are described and empirical results given.cacm august, broder, s.ca jb march ,   : pm
