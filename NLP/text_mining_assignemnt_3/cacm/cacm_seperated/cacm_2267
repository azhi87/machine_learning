algorithms to reveal properties of floating-point arithmetic.wtwo algorithms are presented in the form offortran subroutines.  each subroutine computes the radix and number of digits of the floating-pointnumbers and whether rounding or chopping is done by the machine on which it is run.  the methods areshown to work on any "reasonable" floating-point computer.cacm november, malcolm, m. a..kfloating-point arithmetic, high-levellanguages, philosophy of language design.c. .ca jb january ,   : pm
