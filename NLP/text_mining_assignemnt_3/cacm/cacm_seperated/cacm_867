least squares fitting of planes to surfaces using dynamic programming.wdynamic programming has recently been usedby stone, by bellman and by gluss to determine the closet fit of broken line segments to a curve in aninterval under the constraint that the number of segments is fixed.  in the present paper successivemodels are developed to extend the method to the fitting of broken plane segments to surfaces z=g(x,y) definedover certain types of subareas of the (x,y)-space.  the first model considers a rectangular area, withthe constraint that the plane segments are defined over a grid in the (x,y)-space.  it is then shown howthis model may be incorporated into an algorithm that provides successive approximations to optimal fitsfor any type of closed area.  finally, applications are briefly described.cacm april, gluss, b.ca jb march ,   : am
