sorting in a paging environment.wthis sorting study was part of an extensive measurement projectundertaken on the m/x, an experimental paging system which wasconceived and implemented at ibm research in order to explore thevirtual machine concept.  the study was concerned with the implementation of sorting procedures in the context of the dynamic pagingenvironment characteristic of virtual memory machines.  descriptions of the experimental sort programs and analysis of the performancemeasurement results obtained for them are presented. the insight gained from the experimental effort is used to arrive at a set ofbroad guidelines for writing sort programs for a paging environment.cacm august, brawn, b. s.gustavson, g.mankin, e. s..ksorting, merging, virtual machines, paging systems, dynamicstorage allocation, measurement of systems program behavior,performance evaluation, memory management.c. . . .ca jb february ,   : pm
