proof techniques for hierarchically structured programs.wa method for describing and structuring programsthat simplifies proofs of their correctness is presented.  the method formally represents a programin terms of levels of abstraction, each level of which can be described by a self-contained nonproceduralspecification.  the proofs, like the programs, are structured by levels.  although only manual proofsare described in the paper, the method is also applicable to semi-automatic and automatic proofs.  preliminaryresults are encouraging, indicating that the method can be applied to large programs, such as operating systems.cacm april, robinson, l.levitt, k. n..khierarchical structure, program verification, structuredprogramming, formal specification, abstraction, and programming methodology.c. . . .ca jb december ,   : am
