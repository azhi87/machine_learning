analysis of boolean program models for time-shared, paged environments.wdirected graphs or their associated matrices arefrequently used to represent the logical structure of sequences of computer instructions.  such techniquesare used and, in addition, data references are represented in a nondirected model. the complete structuralspecification of a program is represented by a combined model.  a transformation of the combinedmodel yields a new model in which additional timing information is also contained.  analysis of these modelsprior to execution yields information valuable in determining segmentation of instructions and data fora time-shared environment, as well as for initial page loading; during execution, the analysis may beused for "look ahead" control of page turning.cacm april, lowe, t. c..ktime-sharing, paging, segmentation, executive,compiler, monitor, program model.c. .ca jb february ,   : pm
