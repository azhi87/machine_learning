evaluation and selection of file organization-a model and system.wthis work first discusses the factors thataffect file (data base) organization performance, an elusive subject, and then presents a methodology, amodel and a programmed system to estimate primarily total storage costs and average access time of severalfile organizations, given a specific data base, query characterization and device-related specifications. based on these estimates, an appropriate file structure may be selected for the specific situation. the system is a convenient tool to study file structures and to facilitate as much as possible the processof data base structure design and evaluation.cacm september, cardenas, a. f..kfile organization, file structures, file management,file organization performance, file organization model, file structure design, secondary index organization,simulation, data base, access time, storage requirement, data base analysis, data management.c. . . . . .ca jb january ,   : am
