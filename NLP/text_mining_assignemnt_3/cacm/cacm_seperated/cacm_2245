trace-driven modeling and analysis ofcpu scheduling in multiprogramming system.wmicroscopic level job stream data obtained ina production environment by an event-driven software probe is used to drive a model of a multiprogrammingcomputer system.  the cpu scheduling algorithm of the model is systematically varied.  this technique,called trace-driven modeling, provides an accurate replica of a production environment for the testing of variationsin the system.  at the same time alterations in scheduling methods can be easily carried out in acontrolled way with cause and effects relationships being isolated.  the scheduling methods tested includedthe best possible and worst possible methods, the traditional methods of multiprogramming theory, round-robin,first-come-first-served, etc., and dynamic predictors.  the relative and absolute performances ofthese scheduling methods are given.  it is concluded that a successful cpu scheduling method must be preemptiveand must prevent a given job from holding the cpu for too long a period.cacm december, sherman, s.baskett iii, f.browne, j. c..kscheduling, cpu scheduling,multiprogramming,performance measurement, trace driven models.c. . . .ca jb january ,   : am
