continued operation notation for symbolmanipulation and array processing.wa brief account is given of a notational devicethat is very useful in the formal representation of syntaxes, string relationships and string transformationprocedures and also of computing procedures that deal with arrays of functions of many variables. the device consists of the use of certain "continued operation" or "collective" symbols that are analogous to the summationsymbol (sigma) and continued multiplication symbol (pi) of conventional mathematics.cacm august, barnett, m. p.ca jb march ,   : pm
