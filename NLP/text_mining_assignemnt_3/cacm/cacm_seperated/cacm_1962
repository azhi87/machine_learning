groove-a program to compose, store, and edit functions of time.wa program which makes possible creating, storing, reproducing,and editing functions of time is described.  the functions are typicalof those generated by human beings.  multiple functions (up to )are produced for long periods of time (up to several hours) atsufficiently high sampling rates to describe fast human reactions(up to  samples per second).  the functions can be used for avariety of purposes such as the control of machine tools or soundsynthesizers or anything a person normally controls.  the programoperates on a small computer (ddp-).  functions are stored on adisk file.  functions may be created by real-time human inputs tothe computer which can interact with already stored functions andcomputed functions.  real-time feedback from the process beingcontrolled is an important link in the system.  the environment foreffective man-machine interaction has been carefully nurtured.cacm december, mathews, m. v.moore, f. r..kcomputer music, music, real-time control, digital control, timefunctions, interactive software, hybrid systems, conductor program.c. . .ca jb february ,   : pm
