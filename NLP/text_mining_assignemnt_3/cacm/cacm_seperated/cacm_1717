generating prime implicants via ternary encoding and decimal arithmetic.wdecimal arithmetic, ternary encoding of cubes,and topological considerations are used in an algorithm to obtain the extremals and prime implicantsof boolean functions. the algorithm, which has been programmed in the fortran language, generally requiresless memory than other minimization procedures, and treats don't care terms in an efficient manner.cacm july, dietmeyer, d. l.duley, j. r..kprime implicants, extremal, switching function,minimization, cubical complexes, ternary encoding.c. .ca jb february ,   : am
