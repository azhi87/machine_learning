computer photocomposition of technical text.win computer assisted typesetting by means ofphotocomposition, special problems arise in highly technical material such as mathematical formulas.  newsolutions to several of these problems have been devised in the information system of the american instituteof physics.  they include: the representation of special characters (foreign alphabets, mathematicalsymbols, etc.) not available on input keyboards or on the photocomposer; the generation of such symbols,e.g. by overprinting; the precise positioning of accent marks (floating diacritics); line breaks,i.e. words or formulas placed partly at the end of one line and partly at the beginning of the next;and certain aspects of error correction.cacm june, alt, f. l.yuni kirk, j..kphotocomposition, typesetting, printing, graphics, text processing.c. .ca jb january ,   : pm
