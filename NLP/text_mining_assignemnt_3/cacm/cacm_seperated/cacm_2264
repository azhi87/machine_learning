derived semantics for some programming language constructs.wthe constructs of a simple programming languageare introduced and described informally in terms of values and side-effects.  a translator is definedwhich translates the language into flowcharts for a simple machine.  the action of the machine in executinga flowchart is defined.  a proof is constructed that the effect of translating and executing any programcan be expressed solely in terms of the value and side-effect of the program.  during the course ofconstructing the proof, formal definitions of the concepts of value and side-effect are derived in orderto make the proof rigorous.  correctness of the implementation involves checking that the definitions derivedin the step above are an acceptable formalization of the informal description given in the first step.cacm november, henderson, p..klambda calculus, formal description, programcorrectness, programming languages, semantics.c. . .ca jb january ,   : pm
