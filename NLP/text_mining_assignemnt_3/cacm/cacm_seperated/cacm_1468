syntax-directed interpretation of classes of pictures.wa descriptive scheme for classes of pictures basedon labeling techniques using parallel processing algorithms was proposed by the author some years ago. since then much work has been done in applying this to bubble chamber pictures.  the parallel processingsimulator, originally written for an ibm system, has now been rewritten for a cdc  system. this paper descriptive models by considering their specific application to bubble chamber pictures.  howthe description generated in this phase can be embedded in a larger "conversation" program is explainedby means of a certain specific example that has been worked out.  a partial generative grammar for"handwritten" english letters is given, as are also a few computer-generated outputs using this grammarand the parallel processing simulator mentioned earlier.cacm march, narasimhan, r.ca jb march ,   : pm
