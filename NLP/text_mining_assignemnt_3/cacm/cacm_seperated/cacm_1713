on overcoming high-priority paralysisin multiprogramming systems: a case his tory.whigh-priority paralysis is the degradationthat can occur in multiprogramming systems when scheduling is based primarily on preassigned priorities. it can be alleviated by modifying the scheduling algorithm to maximize the number of programs activeat one time.  the case his tory given in this paper indicates two general methods by which simultaneity canbe increased.  possible refinements in the scheduling algorithm for future improvements are considered briefly.cacm august, stevens, d. f..kmultiprogram scheduling, dynamic priority assignment scheduling.c. . .ca jb february ,   : am
