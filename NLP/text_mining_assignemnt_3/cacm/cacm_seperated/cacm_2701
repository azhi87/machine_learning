a fast and usually linear algorithm for globalflow analysis (abstract only--complete paper jacm , january, ).wa new algorithm for global flow analysis onreducible graphs is presented. the algorithm is shown to treat a very general class of function spaces. for a graph of e edges, the algorithm has a worst case time bound of o(e log e) function operations. it is also shown that in programming terms, the number of operations is proportional to e plus thenumber of exits from program loops.  consequently a restriction to one-entry one-exit control structureslinearity.  the algorithm can be extended to yet larger classes of function spaces and graphs by relaxingthe time bound.  examples are given of code improvement problems which can be solved using the algorithm.cacm december, graham, s. l.wegman, m..kglobal flow analysis, data flow, code optimization,common subexpression elimination, live-dead analysis, information propagation, flow graph, reducibility,go-to-less programming, depth-first search, path compression.c. . . .ca jb january ,   : pm
