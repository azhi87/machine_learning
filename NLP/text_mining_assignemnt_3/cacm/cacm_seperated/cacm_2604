an interactive graphic display for regionpartitioning by linear programming.wusing linear programming, an interactive graphicdisplay system has been implemented to solve the region design problem of partitioning a region inton nonoverlapping subregions in such a way that their areas are in specified proportions and that thetotal cost of servicing them is a minimum.  in a conversational manner, a user can easily obtain differentpartitionings by specifying and modifying the boundary, the service centers' locations, the areaproportions, and the cost functions.  examples are included.cacm september, cheung, t..kinteractive graphic display, region partitioning,area specification, linear programming.c. . .ca jb january ,   : am
