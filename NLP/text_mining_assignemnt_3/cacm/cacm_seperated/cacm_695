use of the disk file on stretch.wthe paper begins by briefly describing thestretch (ibm ) computer with special emphasis given to the organization and operation of its input-outputequipment.  physical characteristics of the two-disk system (,, -bit words,  usec-per-wordtransmission rate, etc.) are noted.  timing limitations due to arm motion and disk rotation are discussed. applications of disk usage are discussed separately for problem programs and for systems programssuch as compilers and the supervisory program. approximately , words of disk storage are reservedfor the storage of systems programs and the subroutine library.  problem programs, however, are notcurrently filed on the disk.  certain programming techniques are discussed for transmitting words betweendisk and core storage with minimum delaying and interruption of the arithmetic unit.  dumps on disk areconsidered for both recovery from computer malfunction and for mathematical or physical developments duringthe calculation.  some comments are made regarding the reliability, economics, utility and weaknesses orlimitations of the disk system.  several possible future applications are noted which appear to have disk connotations.cacm october, carlson, b. g.voorhes, e. a.ca jb march ,   : pm
