formal parsing systems.wautomatic syntactic analysis has recently becomeimportant for both natural language data processing and syntax-directed compilers.  a formal parsing systemg = (v,u,t,r) consists of two finite disjoint vocabularies, v and t, a many-many map, u, from v ontot, and a recursive set r of strings in t called syntactic sentence classes.  every program for automaticsyntactic analysis determines a formal parsing system.  a directed production analyzer (i,t,x,p) is anondeterministic pushdown-store machine with internal vocabulary i, input vocabulary t, and all productionsof p in the form:  (z,a) -> ay ... ym where  z, yi are elements of the set i and a is an element of theset t.  every context-free language can be analyzed by a directed production analyzer.  the kuno-oettingermultiple-path syntactic analyzer for english is a concrete example of a directed production analyzerand of a working parsing algorithm.  the connection between structures assigned by the analyzer and those ofa conventional phrase structure grammar is examined in this paper.cacm august, greibach, s. a.ca jb march ,   : pm
