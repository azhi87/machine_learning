the treatment of data types in el.win constructing a general purpose programminglanguage, a key issue is providing a sufficient set of data types and associated operations in a mannerthat permits both natural problem-oriented notation and efficient implementation.  the el language containsa number of features specifically designed to simultaneously satisfy both requirements.  the resultingtreatment of data types includes provision for programmer-defined data types data types and genericroutines, programmer control over type conversion, and very flexible data type behavior, in a context thatallows efficient compiled code and compact data representation.cacm may, wegbreit, b..kdata types, modes, mode unions, type conversion,coercion, generic functions, extensible languages, data type definition, data description language, compilation.c. . .ca jb january ,   : pm
