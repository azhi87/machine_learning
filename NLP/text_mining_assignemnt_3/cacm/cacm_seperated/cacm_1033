experimental personalized array translator system.wa system designed for intimate man-machineinteraction in a general-purpose problem-solving environment is experimentally operational.  the systemutilizers an array-oriented symbolic source language containing powerful statement types.  these include numeric,boolean, relational and selection operators on operands which can be entire arrays.  the system alsopermits simple specification of test and argument arrays in single statements.  the completely symbolicoperating system includes display and entry of program and data.  sequence control is aided by an interruptswitch which allows the user to interact with the program during execution. in addition to normalstored program sequencing, the system provides trace options and the ability to enter any statementfor immediate execution.  present implementation of the system is with an interpretive translator on an ibm  computer.cacm july, hellerman, h.ca jb march ,   : pm
