aparel-a parse-request language.waparel is described: this language is an extensionto an algorithmic language (pl/i) that provides the pattern-matching capabilities normally found onlyin special purpose languages such as snobol and tmg.  this capability is provided through parse-requestsstated in a bnf-like format.  these parse-requests form their own programming language with special sequencingrules.  upon successfully completing a parse-request, an associated piece of pl/i code is executed.  thiscode has available for use, as normal pl/i strings the various pieces (at all levels) of the parse.  italso has available as normal pl/i variables, theinformation concerning which of the various alternativeswere successful.  convenient facilities for multiple input-output streams, the initiation of sequencesof parse-requests as a subroutine, and parse-time semantic checks are also included.  aparel has proven convenient in building a powerful syntax and function macro system, an algebraic language preprocessor debuggingsystem, an on-line command parser, a translator for dataless programming, and as a general string manipulator.cacm november, balzer, r. m.farber, d. j..ktext processing, string processing, symbol manipulation,pl/i, bnf, syntax, parser, translator, pattern matching.c. . . . .ca jb february ,   : pm
