subgoal induction.wa proof method, subgoal induction, is presentedas an alternative or supplement to the commonly used inductive assertion method.  its major virtue is thatit can often be used to prove a loop's correctness directly from its input-output specification without theuse of an invariant.  the relation between subgoal induction and other commonly used induction rules is exploredand, in particular, it is shown that subgoal induction can be viewed as a specialized form of computationinduction.  a set of sufficient conditions are presented which guarantee that an input-output specificationis strong enough for the induction steps of a proof by subgoal induction to be valid.cacm april, morris, j. h. jr.wegbreit, b..kprogram verification, proving programs correct,induction rule, computation induction, inductive assertions, structural induction, proof rule,recursive programs, iterative programs.c. . . .ca jb december ,   : am
