the structure of programming languages.win this paper the major components of everyprogramming language are identified as: () the elementary program statement, () mechanisms for linkingelementary statements together, () the means by which a program can obtain data inputs.  severalalternative forms of each of these components are also described, compared and evaluated.  many examples,frequently from list processing languages, illustrate the forms described.  the advantages, disadvantages andfactors influencing the choice of a form of component for a language are discussed, and the paper concludeswith the suggestion that programming languages evolve toward one which will permit all the most convenientways of structuring programs, organizing systems and referencing data.cacm february, raphael, b.ca jb march ,   : pm
