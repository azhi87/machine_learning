orderly enumeration of nonsingular binarymatrices applied to text encryption.wnonsingular binary matrices of order n, i.e.,nonsingular over the field {, }, and an initial segment of the natural numbers are placed in one-to-onecorrespondence.  each natural number corresponds to two intermediate vectors.  these vectors are mapped intoa nonsingular binary matrix.  examples of complete enumeration of all  x  and  x  nonsingularbinary matrices were produced by mapping the intermediate vectors to the matrices.  the mappinghas application to the vernam encipherment method using pseudorandom number sequences.  a bit string formedform bytes of text of a data encryption key can be used as a representation of a natural number. this natural number is transformed to a nonsingular binary matrix.  key leverage is obtained by using thematrix as a"seed" in a shift register sequence pseudorandom number generator.  cacm april, payne, w.h.mcmillen, k.l..kbinary matrices, combinatorics, combinations, nonsingularmatrices, encryption, vernam, pseudorandom numbers, feedback shiftregister sequences, random numbers..c. .ca dh february ,   : am
