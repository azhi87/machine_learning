on the expected lengths of sequences generatedin sorting by replacement selecting.win the replacement-selecting technique of sorting,one is interested in the ratio l(j) of the expected length of the j-th sequence generated by thetechnique to the number of memory cells used.  using complex-variable theory, it is shown that l(j)->  and that, asymptotically, the average interval between sign changes of l(j)- is ..cacm july, hooker, w. w..kreplacement selecting, sorting, sequence lengths,asymptotic expected length, recursion relation, generating function, meromorphic function.c. .ca jb february ,   : pm
