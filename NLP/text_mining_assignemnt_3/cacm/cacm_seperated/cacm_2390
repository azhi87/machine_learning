a proposal for a computer-based interactive scientific community.wbecause of the problems created by the explosionof papers in the mathematical sciences and the drawbacks that this places on research, it is suggestedthat a tree of all mathematical results and terminology be maintained in a multiterminal computer system. users of the system can store in the computer an updated file of their current knowledge, and on selectinga paper to read, they can obtain from the computer the minimum subtree of theorems required to bringthem from what they already know to the background knowledge which the paper assumes.  under certain conditions,means are also provided for the contribution of useful comments by the readers of a work and for interactionbetween commentators and with the author.  this paper describes how the system can be organizedand the role required of readers, writers, and commentators. cacm february, pager, d..kinteractive system, organization of scientific community,readers, writers, commentators, computer utility, information retrieval, trees, data structures.c. . . . . . . . . . . .ca jb february ,   : am
