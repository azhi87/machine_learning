computational algorithms for closed queueingnetworks with exponential servers.wmethods are presented for computing the equilibriumdistribution of customers in closed queueing networks with exponential servers.  expressions forvarious marginal distributions are also derived.  the computational algorithms are based on two-dimensionaliterative techniques which are highly efficient and quite simple to implement.  implementation considerationssuch as storage allocation strategies and order of evaluation are examined in some detail.cacm september, buzen, j. p..kqueueing theory, queueing networks, equilibriumdistributions, steady state distributions.c. . . .ca jb january ,   : am
