numerical analysis in a ph.d. computer science program.wnumerical analysis is the study of methods andprocedures used to obtain "approximate solutions" to mathematical problems.  much of the emphasis is on scientificcalculation.  the difficulties of education in such a broad area center around the question of backgroundand emphasis.  the numerical analysis program in the computer science department should emphasize anawareness of the problems of computer implementation and experimental procedures.  nevertheless, there is aneed for a solid background in applied mathematics.cacm december, parter, s. v..kph.d. program, numerical analysis, course separation, education.c.ca jb february ,   : pm
