operational compatibility of systems-conventions.wthe general standards committee of the shareorganization has devoted considerable effort to the problem of operating a computer efficiently inview of the growing number of programming systems available.  each of these programming systems has beencoded to utilize a fixed set of hardware components without recognizing the fact that others may be occupyinga storage medium required by the first.  these incompatibilities are currently resolved by manually settingup the computer for each system as required.  the following set of conventions is being consideredto minimize computer set-up time.  they are of sufficiently broad interest that we feel other computerusers should be aware of them. -george f. ryckman, chairmancacm june, bright, h. s.ca jb march ,   : pm
