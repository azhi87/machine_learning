lucid, a nonprocedural language with iteration.wlucid is a formal system in which programscan be written and proofs of programs carried out.  the proofs are particularly easy to follow and straightforwardto produce because the statements in a lucid program are simply axioms from which the proofproceeds by (almost) conventional logical reasoning, with the help of a few axioms and rules of inferencefor the special lucid functions.  as a programming language, lucid is unconventional because, among otherthings, the order of statements is irrelevant and assignment statements are equations.  nevertheless,lucid programs need not look much different than iterative programs in a conventional structured programminglanguage using assignment and conditional statements and loops.cacm july, ashcrof, e. a.wadge, w. w..kprogram proving, formal systems, semantics,iteration, structured programming.c. .ca jb december ,   : am
