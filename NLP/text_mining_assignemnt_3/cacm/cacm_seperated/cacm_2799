stably updating mean and standard deviation of data.wby considering the (sample) mean of a set ofdata as a fit to this data by a constant function, a computational method is given based on a matrix formulationand givens transformations. the (sample) mean and standard deviation can be updated as dataaccumulates.  the procedure is numerically stable and does not require storage of the data.  methods fordealing with weighted data and data removal are presented.  when updating the mean and square of thestandard deviation, the process requires no square roots.cacm january, hanson, r. j..kmean, standard deviation, least squares, givenstransformation, updating estimates, removing data.c. .ca jb january ,   : am
