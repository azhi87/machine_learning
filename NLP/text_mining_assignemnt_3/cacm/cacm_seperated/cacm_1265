on the relative efficiencies of context-free grammar recognizers.wa number of diverse recognition proceduresthat have been proposed for parsing sentences with respect to a context-free grammar are described in thispaper by means of a common device.  each procedure is defined by giving an algorithm for obtaining a nondeterministicturing machine recognizer that is equivalent to a given context-free grammar.  the formalizationof the turing machine has been chosen to make possible particularly simple description ofthe parsing procedures considered.  an attempt has been made to compare recognition efficiencies for theprocedures defined.  for a few simple grammars and sentences a formal comparison has been made.  empiricalcomparison of the recognition of more realistic programming languages such as lisp and algol has beenmade by means of a program which simulates the turing machine on the univac m- computer.  severalalgorithms for producing grammars equivalent to a given context-free grammar have been considered, andthe increase in recognition efficiency they afford has been empirically investigated.cacm may, griffiths, t. v.petrick, s. r.ca jb march ,   : pm
