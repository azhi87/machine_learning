permutation enumeration: four new permutation algorithms.wclassical permutation enumeration algorithms encounterspecial cases requiring additional computation every nth permutation when generating the n! permutationson n marks.  four new algorithms have the attribute that special cases occur every n(n-)permutations. two of the algorithms produce the next permutation with a single exchange of two marks.  the other two algorithmsinfrequently exchange more than two marks, but the rules for generating the next permutation arevery simple.  performance tests which have counted execution of assignment statements, comparisons, arithmeticoperations, and subscripted array references have shown superiority of the new algorithms compared toboothroyd's implementation of m. b. well's algorithm and ehrlich's implementation of the johnson-trotter algorithm.cacm february, ives, f. m..kpermutations, loop-free algorithms.c.ca jb january ,   : am
