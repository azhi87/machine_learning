a decision matrix as the basis for a simple data input routine.wcurrently a great deal of time and effort isbeing spent on the development of bigger and better compiler languages, multiprogram executive systems,etc.  since the implementation of  of new methods and procedures is not instantaneous, but rather occursby an evolutionary process, we should be concerned also with the problem of maintaining, improving andincorporating new ideas into existing systems.  it is with this somewhat neglected area that the author isinterested.  a method employing a decision matrix is presented for the handling of a standard systemsprogramming problem,that of providing a data input routine.cacm december, vasilakos, g. j.ca jb march ,   : pm
