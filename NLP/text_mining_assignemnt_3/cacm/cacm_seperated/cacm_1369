half rotations in n-dimensional euclidean space.wan iterative procedure is described for determininghalf rotations in n-dimensional euclidean space. the method is a variant of the cyclic jacobiprocedure and utilizers elementary plane rotations to obtain the half rotation matrix.  numerical examples are given.cacm september, mccamon, r. b.ca jb march ,   : pm
