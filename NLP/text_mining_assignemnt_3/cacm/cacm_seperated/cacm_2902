dynamic memory allocation in computer simulation.wthis paper investigates the performance of dynamic memory allocation algorithms when used to service simulation programs as represented by test cases.  algorithm performance was measured interms of processing time, memory usage, and external memoryfragmentation.  algorithms main taining separate free space lists for each size of memory block usedtended to perform quite well compared with other algorithms.  simple algorithms operating on memory orderedlists (without any free list) performed surprisingly well.  algorithms employing power-of-two block sizeshad favorable processing requirements but generally unfavorable memory usage.  algorithms employing lifo, fifo,or memory ordered free lists generally performed poorly compared with others.cacm november, nielsen, n. r..kalgorithm performance,dynamic memory allocation, dynamicmemory management, dynamic storage allocation, garbage collection, list processing, memory allocation,memory management, programming techniques, simulation, simulation memory management, simulation techniques,space allocation, storage allocation.c. . . .ca jb december ,   : am
