on arithmetic expressions and trees.wa description is given of how a tree representing theevaluation of an arithmetic expression can be drawn in such a way that the number of accumulatorsneeded for the computation can be represented in a straightforward manner.  this representation reducesthe choice of the best order of computation to a specific problem under the theory of graphs. an algorithm to solve this problem is presented.cacm february, redziejowski, r. r..karithmetic expression, compiler design, graph theory,programming, storage minimization, topological ordering,tree.c. .ca jb february ,   : am
