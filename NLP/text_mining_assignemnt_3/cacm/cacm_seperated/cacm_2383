music and computer composition.wthe problem discussed is that of simulating humancomposition of western popular music by computer and some relevant theories of music and harmony are given. problems with this kind of program and several schemes that are known not to work are discussed.  severalprevious computer compositions are discussed, including the illiac suite.  a program to generate shortmelody fragments was written to simulate some of the aspects of human composition.  five samples ofits output are presented and discussed.  it was discovered that although the fragments show many ofthe characteristics of popular melodies, they have a strangely alien sound.  it is theorized that thisis because the relevant probabilities which would discriminate against unfamiliar sequences were not used.cacm february, moorer, j. a..kartificial intelligence, heuristic programming,models of cognitive processes, computer music, computer composition, music theory.c. .ca jb january ,   : pm
