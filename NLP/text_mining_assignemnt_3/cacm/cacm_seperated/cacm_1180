axle: an axiomatic language for string transformations.waxle is a language designed for data manipulation. data arranged in a linear form in a workspace is transformed according to a table of axioms, called imperatives. a transformation consists of a matching procedure, which decides where an imperative is applicable,and a replacement procedure that modifies that part of the workspace.  imperatives are appliedin accordance with definitions of symbolic terms, presented systematically in an assertion table.  theprocess of definition includes the special case of recursive assertions.  several complete programsof imperatives are given to show a few applicationsof the language.cacm november, cohen, i.wegstein, j. h.ca jb march ,   : pm
