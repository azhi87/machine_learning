integral equations of immunology.wthe inversion of a particular integral equationof the first (fredholm) kind is the basic problem considered.  the strategy which yielded success consistedof three essential points: () fit the known experimental data by a curve with properties which derivefrom properties of the (as yet unknown) function; () stabilize the computation for the unknown functionby using singular value decomposition; () constrain the unknown function approximation (since it representsa probability distribution) to be nonnegative.  a number of test cases are presented. one set of actualexperimental data is analyzed with the procedures presented.cacm october, hanson, r. j..kintegral equations of the first kind, nonnegativeconstraints, singular value analysis.c. . . .ca jb january ,   : pm
