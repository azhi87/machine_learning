methods of convergence improvement for some improper integrals.win the numerical integration of an improperintegral of the first kind, it is customary to truncate the integral when the change yielded by the lastiteration is less than some predetermined constant. the efficiency of such integration schemes can oftenbe improved by use of recent advances in the theory of nonlinear transformations; however, for several importantintegrals, e.g. integrals whose integrands are rational polynomials, these transformations failto yield much improvement.  in this paper, several methods of convergence improvement are developed which greatlyimprove convergence of some improper integrals, including the integrals of rational polynomials.cacm july, mcwilliams, g. v.thompson, r. w..kapproximation, nonlinear, improper integral, convergenceimprovement, numerical integration, rational polynomials, truncation.c. . . .ca jb february ,   : am
