an algol compiler: construction and usein relation to an elaborate operating system.wan algol translator has been prepared and integratedinto the ibsys operating system.  assembly and "go" features of ibsys permit immediate execution withoptional listings, decks and debugging information.  using the chain feature of ibsys, links written inmap or fortran as well as algol may be called by the algol main program.  in addition, procedures codedin map may be included in any algol program.  although assembly plus loading time exceeds compilationtime, the total time is satisfactory and the user gets ease and facility which are fully compensating.cacm march, boussard, j. c.ca jb march ,   : pm
