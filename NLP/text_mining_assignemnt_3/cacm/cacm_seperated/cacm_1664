an algorithm for deriving the equations ofmathematical physics by symbolic manipulation.wa method is described whereby a digital computercan be used to derive the equations of mathematical physics in any curvilinear coordinate system requestedby the user.  the effectiveness of the technique is demonstrated by using it to derive the navier-stokesequations of fluid motion and the continuity equation.  to derive these equations by this method, theuser need know only the coordinate transformation equations relating the curvilinear coordinates of interestto an orthogonal cartesian triad. when this program is used and the coordinate transformation equationsare supplied as input, the computer will derive the navier-stokes equations and the continuityequation.  the equations obtained will be relative to the curvilinear coordinate system specified by thetransformation equations used as input.  in this paper the emphasis is on theoretical considerations andmethodology rather than on programming details.  results are presented for cylindrical polarand spherical polar coordinate systems.cacm december, howard, j. c.tashjian, h..kformac, navier-strokes equations, continuity equation,tensor, tensor equation, curvilinear coordinate systems, fortran, symbolic manipulation.c. . . . .ca jb february ,   : pm
