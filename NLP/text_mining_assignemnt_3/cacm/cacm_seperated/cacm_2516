hierarchical storage in information retrieval.wa probabilistic analysis is employed to determinethe effect of hierarchical storage organizations on information retrieval operations.  the data storagehardware is assumed to consist on n-levels of linearly connected memory hardware with increasing dataaccess times and increasing data storage capabilities.  a system might, for example, consist of fast semiconductormemory, computer core memory, extended core storage, disk memory, and data cells.  equations are derivedto predict the effect of such a system on data access times using sequential files, random access files,and structured files employing multiple-hierarchical linked lists.cacm may, salasin, j..kinformation retrieval, hierarchical storage.c. . . . . . . .ca jb january ,   : am
