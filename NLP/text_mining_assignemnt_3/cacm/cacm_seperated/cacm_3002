a record and file partitioning model.wone of the main objectives in the design ofa file system is the reduction of storage and data transfer costs.  this paper presents a model in whichseveral  requests access the file system, and each request requires information from one or more variablelength data-items.  the probabilities of access and the distribution of each data-item's length are assumedto be known, and to be mutually independent. the file system uses one or more storage devices, andeach record may be partitioned into subrecords that are stored on different devices.  one of the subrecordsis designated as the primary record; when a request for a record is made, the primary record isfirst accessed, and other subrecords are accessed only if the pertinent information is not stored in theprimary record.  the model that is presented in this paper, both as a nonlinear programming model anda mixed integer programming model, is a very general one; several types of file systems may be derived fromit by an appropriate selection of its parameters.  this model has already been used in the optimization oflibrary routines' storage at a large scale operating system.cacm january, babad, j. m..kfile system, file design, file partitioning, record partitioning.c.ca jb january ,   : am
