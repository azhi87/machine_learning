dynamic response time prediction for computer networks.wif the ultimate aim of a computing networkis resource sharing, then the human component as well as the technical component of networking mustbe fully investigated to achieve this goal.  this research is a first step toward assisting the user in participatingin the vast store of resources available on a network. analytical, simulation, and statistical performanceevaluation tools are employed to investigate the feasibility of a dynamic response time monitorthat is capable of providing comparative response time information for users wishing to process variouscomputing applications at some network computing node.  the research clearly reveals that sufficientsystem data are currently obtainable, at least for the five diverse arpa network systems studied in detail,to describe and predict the response time for network time-sharing systems as it depends on somemeasure of system activity or load level.cacm july, mamrak, s. a..kresponse time monitor, computer networks, time-sharingsystems, comparative response time, arpa network, anlytic modeling, simulation, benchmark jobs, system measurement.c. . .ca jb december ,   : pm
