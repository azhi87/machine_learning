perfect hashing functions: a singleprobe retrieving method for static sets.wa refinement of hashing which allows retrievalof an item in a static table with a single probe is considered.  given a set i of identifiers, two methodsare presented for building, in a mechanical way, perfect hashing functions, i.e. functions transformingthe elements of i into unique addresses.  the first method, the "quotient reduction" method, isshown to be complete in the sense that for every set i the smallest table in which the elements of ican be stored and from which they can be retrieved by using a perfect hashing function constructed by thismethod can be found.  however, for nonuniformly distributed sets, this method can give rather sparse tables. the second method, the "remainder reduction" method, is not complete in the above sense, but it seemsto give minimal (or almost minimal) tables for every kind of set.  the two techniques are applicabledirectly to small sets.  some methods to extend these results to larger sets are also presented.  a roughcomparison with ordinary hashing is given which shows that this method can be used convenientlyin several practical applications.cacm november, sprugnoli, r..khashing, hashing methods, hash coding, direct addressing,identifier-to-address transformations, perfect hashing functions, perfect hash coding, reduction, scatter storage.c. . .ca jb december ,   : am
