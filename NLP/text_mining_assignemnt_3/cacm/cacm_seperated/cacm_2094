on an algorithm for nonlinear minimax approximation.wcertain nonlinear minimax approximation problems are characterized by properties which permit the application of special algorithms,mainly based on the exchange algorithms of remes (, ), fortheir solution.  in this paper the application to problems of thistype of a general nonlinear algorithm due to osborne and watson() is considered.  examples are given to illustrate that thisalgorithm can give satisfactory results and, in particular, cansuccessfully solve problems which lead to difficultieswith the more conventional specialist method.cacm march, watson, g. a..kminimax approximation, nonlinear approximation, linear programming.c. .ca jb february ,   : pm
