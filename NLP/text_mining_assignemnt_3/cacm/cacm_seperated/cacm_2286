automatic error analysis for determining precision.wthe problem considered is that of evaluating arational expression to within any desired tolerance on a computer which performs variable-precision floating-pointarithmetic operations.    an automatic error analysis technique is given for determining, directlyfrom the results of a trial low-precision interval arithmetic calculation, just how much precisionand data accuracy are required to achieve a desired final accuracy.  the technique given generalizeeasily to the evaluation of many nonrational expressions.cacm september, richman, p. l..kerror analysis, interval arithmetic, precision control.c.ca jb january ,   : pm
