sabrag, a time-sharing low-cost computer.wthe serial sabrac computer designed and builtin the scientific department of the israel defense ministry has a -location magnetic drum, main store. to avoid a need to resort to optimum programming techniques and to increase its overall efficiency thecomputer has also been given a -word ferrite core store from which the program is obeyed.  transfersbetween the core and drum stores and to and from the twin paper-tape input and output channels are allavailable autonomously (concurrently, time-shared).  multiplication and division orders are also autonomous,so that the machine may be executing up to three orders simultaneously.  all functions naturally are interlocked. a number of other advanced orders and facilities are also incorporated.in particular, an"execute" order permits a temporary jump for up to four orders and a second modifier register permits doublemodification in general and relative addressing of subroutines in particular.  thus the overall effectivespeed of the machine is muchhigher than its basic specification would lead one to expect and itsdesign indicates one way in which the concepts of time sharing may be incorporated in "low-cost" computers.cacm august, lehman, m.netter, z.eshed, r.ca jb march ,   : pm
