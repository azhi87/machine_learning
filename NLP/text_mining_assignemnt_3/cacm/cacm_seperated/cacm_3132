experiments with some algorithms that findcentral solutions for pattern classification.win two-class pattern recognition, it is a standardtechnique to have an algorithm finding hyperplaneswhich separates the two classes in a linearly separable trainingset.  the traditional methods find a hyperplane which separates allpoints in the other, but such a hyperplane is not necessarily centeredin the empty space between the two classes.  since a centralhyperplane does not favor one class or the other, it should havea lower error rate in classifying new points and is therefore betterthan a noncentral hyperplane.  six algorithms for finding centralhyperplanes are tested on three data sets.  although frequentlyused practice, the modified relaxation algorithm is very poor. three algorithms which are defined in the paper are found to bequite good.cacm march, slagle, j..kpattern recognition, pattern classification, linear discriminants, centralhyperplanes, centering, centrality criteria, dead zone, hyperplane,linearly separable, relaxation algorithm, accelerated relaxation.c. .ca dh april ,   : pm
