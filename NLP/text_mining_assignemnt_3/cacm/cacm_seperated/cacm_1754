dynamic storage allocation systems.win many recent computer system designs, hardwarefacilities have been provided for easing the problems of storage allocation.  a method of characterizingdynamic storage allocation systems-according to the functional capabilities provided and the underlyingtechniques used-is presented.  the basic purpose of the paper is to provide a useful perspective fromwhich the utility of various hardware facilities may be assessed.  a brief survey of storage allocationfacilities in several representative computer systems is included as an appendix.cacm may, randell, b.kuehner, c. j..ksegmentation, paging, multiprogramming, storageallocation, storage management, virtual memories, storage fragmentation, storage hierarchies, addressing mechanisms.c. .ca jb february ,   : am
