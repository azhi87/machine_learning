reduction: a method of proving properties of parallel programs.wwhen proving that a parallel program has agiven property it is often convenient to assume that a statement is indivisible, i.e. that the statementcannot be interleaved with the rest of the program.  here sufficient conditions are obtained to show thatthe assumption that a statement is indivisible can be relaxed and still preserve properties such ashalting.  thus correctness proofs of a parallel system can often be greatly simplified.cacm december, lipton, r. j..kdeadlock free, reduction, interruptible, indivisible,parallel program, semaphore, verification method, process, computation sequence.c. . .ca jb january ,   : pm
