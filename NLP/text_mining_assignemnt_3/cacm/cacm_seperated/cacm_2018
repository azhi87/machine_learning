full table quadratic searching for scatter storage.wthe quadratic residue search method for hash tables avoids muchof the clustering experienced with a linear search method.  the simplequadratic search only accesses half the table.  it has been shownthat when the length of the table is a prime of the form n+, where n is an integer, the whole table may be accessed by two quadraticsearches plus a separate access for the original entry point. a search method is presented which is computationally simple, has all the advantages of the quadratic search, and yet accesses all the table in one sweep.cacm august, day, a. c..kquadratic residue, search method, hash tables, scatter storage,dictionary look-up, quadratic search, searching, hashing,hash code, clustering, collisions.c. . .ca jb february ,   : pm
