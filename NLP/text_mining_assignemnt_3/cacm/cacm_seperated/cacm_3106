a fast algorithm for copying list structures.wan algorithm is presented for copying an arbitrarilylinked list structure into a block of contiguous storage locations without destroying  the originallist.  apart from a fixed number of program variables, no auxiliary storage, such as a stack, is used. the algorithm needs no mark bits and operates in linear time.  it is shown to be significantly fasterthan fisher's algorithm, the fastest previous linear-time algorithm for the same problem.  its speedcomes mainly from its efficient list-traversal technique, which folds the processing stack into thestructure being built, and from its classification of list cells into nine types, which enables processingoperations to be optimized for each type.cacm may, clark, d.w..klist copying, lisp, space complexity, constant workspace.c. . .ca dh february ,   : pm
