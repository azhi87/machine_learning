an approximate method for generating symmetric random variables.wa method for generating values of continuoussymmetric random variables that is relatively fast, requires essentially no computer memory, and iseasy to use is developed.  the method, which uses a uniform zero-one random number source, is based onthe inverse function of the lambda distribution of turkey.  since it approximates many of the continuoustheoretical distributions and empirical distributions frequently used in simulations, the method shouldbe useful to simulation practitioners.cacm november, ramberg, j. s.schmeiser, b. w..ksimulation, monte carlo, probability, statistics,approximations, random variables, random numbers, moments, distribution.c. .ca jb january ,   : pm
