interference detection among solids and surfaces.win many industrial environments it is necessary to determine whetherr there is interference among components.  there are many potentialinterference problems in products made up of assemblies of components and in product manufacturing and testing.  typically, drawingsare used in an attempt to detect such unwanted interferences,but the two-dimensional, static drafting medium does not always showinterferences among three-dimensional, moving parts.  this paper presents a computer representation for solids and surfaces and algorithmswhich carry out interference checking among objects so represented.  objects are represented as polyhedra or as piecewise planarsurfaces.  two types of interference checking are discussed:detection of intersections among objects in fixed positions and detectionof collisions among objects moving along specified trajectories.cacm january, boyse, j.w..kinterference checking, intersection detection, collision detection, solidrepresentation, polyhedral representation, graphics, polygons, surfaces.c. .ca dh april ,   : am
