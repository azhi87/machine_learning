variable length tree structures having minimum average search time.wsussenguth suggests in a paper () that afile should be organized as a doubly-chained tree structure if it is necessary both to search and to updatefrequently.  such a structure provides a compromise between the fast search/slow update characteristics ofbinary searching and the slow search/fast update characteristics of serial searching.  his method, however,contains the limiting restriction that all terminal nodes lie on the same level of the tree.  this paperconsiders the effect of relaxing this restriction.  first, trees which have the property that a priori thefilial set of each node is well defined are studied.  it is proved that coding the nodes within each filialset with respect to the number of terminal nodes reachable from each is necessary and sufficient to guaranteeminimum average search time.  then the more general case (that is, where the entire structure ofthe tree is changeable) is treated.  a procedure is developed for constructing a tree with a minimumaverage search time.  a simple closed expression for this minimum average search time is obtained asa function of the number of terminal nodes.  the storage capacity required to implement the doubly-chainedtree structure on a digital computer is also determined.  finally, the total cost of the structure,using sussenguth's cost criterion, is computed.  it is shown that significant improvements in boththe average search time and the total cost can be obtained by relaxing sussenguth's restriction that allterminal nodes lie on the same level of the tree.cacm february, patt, y. n..kinformation retrieval, file searching, tree structures, double chaining.c. . .ca jb february ,   : am
