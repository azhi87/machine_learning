the evolution of the dec system .wthe dec system , also known as the pdp-, evolvedfrom the pdp- (circa ) over five generations of implementations to presently include systems coveringa price range of five to one.  the origin and evolution of the hardware, operating system, and languagesare described in terms of technological change, user requirements, and user developments. the pdp-'scontributions to computing technology include: accelerating the transition from batch oriented to timesharing computing systems; transferring hardware technology within dec (and elsewhere) to minicomputerdesign and manufacturing; supporting minicomputer hardware and software development; and serving as amodel for single user and timeshared interactive minicomputer/microcomputer systems.cacm january, bell, c.g.kotok, a.hastings, t.n.hill, r..kcomputer structures, architecture, operating system, timesharing.c. . .ca jb march ,   : pm
