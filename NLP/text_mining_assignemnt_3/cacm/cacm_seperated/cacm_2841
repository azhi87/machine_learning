designing surfaces in -d.wan experimental system for computer-aideddesign of free-form surfaces in three dimensions is described. the surfaces are represented in the systemas parametric basis splines. the principal features of the system are: () the surfaces are rendered as isoparametricline drawings on a head-mounted display, and they are designed with the aid of a three-dimensional"wand," which allows -d movements of the points controlling the shapes of the surfaces, () all of theinteractions with the surfaces are in real-time, and () the mathematical formulations used assume noknowledge of them by the user of the system.  also examined are some of the features that should be partof a practical -d system for designing space-forms.cacm august, clark, j. h..kreal-time graphics, computer-aided design,picture processing, b-splines, -d displays.c. . .ca jb january ,   : am
