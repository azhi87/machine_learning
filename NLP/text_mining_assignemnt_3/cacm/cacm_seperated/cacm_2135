rapid computation of general interpolationformulas and mechanical quadrature rules.wlet f have n continuous on a closed interval[a,b] and let l be a linear functional.  the attempt is made to approximate l (f) with l (q) where q is a polynomial,approximating f.  algorithms are developed for rapid computation of l (q) for a wide class ofselections of q which includes the lagrangian and hermitian rules as special cases.cacm december, gustafson, s..klinear functionals, divided differences, newton's interpolation formula.c. .ca jb february ,   : am
