implications of structured programming for machine architecture.wbased on an empirical study of more than ,lines of program text written in a goto-less language, a machine architecture specifically designed forstructured programs is proposed.  since assignment, call, return, and if statements together account for percent of all executable statements, special care is given to ensure that these statements can be implementedefficiently.  a highly compact instruction encoding scheme is presented, which can reduce programsize by a factor of .  unlike a huffman code, which utilizes variable length fields, this method usesonly fixed length (-byte) op code and address fields.  the most frequent instructions consist of asingle -byte field.  as a consequence, instruction decoding time is minimized, and the machine isefficient with respect to both space and time.cacm march, tanenbaum, a.s..kmachine architecture, computer architecture, computerorganization, instruction set design, program characteristics.c. . . .ca jb march ,   : pm
