sentence paraphrasing from a conceptual base.wa model of natural language based on an underlyinglanguage-free representation of meaning is described.  a program based on this model is ableto produce sentence paraphrases which demonstrate understanding with respect to a given context.  thisgenerator operates in conjunction with a natural language analyzer and a combined memory and inference model. in generating sentences from meaning structures, the program employs both the information retrieval anddeduction capabilities of the memory model.  the model encompasses several diverse classes of linguisticknowledge, which include: () executable tests of conceptual properties stored in discrimination nets;() information relating conceptual to syntactic roles, stored in a word-sense dictionary, and () surfacegrammatical knowledge, stored in a formal grammar.cacm february, goldman, n. m..kartificial intelligence, natural language processing,language generation, models of cognitive processes, semantic representation.c. . .ca jb january ,   : am
