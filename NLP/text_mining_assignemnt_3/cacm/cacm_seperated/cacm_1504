algorithms for finding a fundamental setof cycles for an undirected linear graph.wgiven the adjacency matrix of the graph, the algorithmpresented in this paper finds a spanning tree and then constructs the set of fundamental cycles. our algorithm is slower than an algorithm presented by welch by a ratio of n/ (n is the number of nodes)but requires less storage.  for graphs with a large number of nodes and edges, when storage is limited ouralgorithm is superior to welch's; however, when the graphs are small, or machine storage is very large,welch's algorithm is superior.  timing estimates and storage requirements for both methods are presented.cacm december, gotlieb, c. c.corneil, d. g.ca jb february , : pm
