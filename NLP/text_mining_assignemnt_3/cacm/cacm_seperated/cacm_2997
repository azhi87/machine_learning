convex hulls of finite sets of poin ts in two and three dimensions.wthe convex hulls of sets of n poin ts in twoand three dimensions can be determined with o(n log n) operations.  the presented algorithms use the "divideand conquer" technique and recursively apply a merge procedure for two nonin tersecting convex hulls. since any convex hull algorithm requires at least o(n log n) operations, the time complexity of theproposed algorithms is optimal within a multiplicative constant.cacm february, preparata, f. p.hong, s. j..kcomputational complexity, convex hull, optimal algorithms,planar set of poin ts, spatial set of poin ts.c. . .ca jb december ,   : am
