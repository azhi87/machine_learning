on programming the numerical solution of polynomial equations.wnumerical techniques are presented for computingthe roots of polynomial equations.  by applying the recommended scaling and inversion rules, the basicbairstow and newton-raphson iterative techniques can be applied with great reliability.  both a high degreeof accuracy and rapid convergence are realized.  numerical examples are shown to illustrate the pitfallsand to show how these are circumvented by application of the recommended procedures.cacm december, ellenberger, k. w.ca jb march ,   : pm
