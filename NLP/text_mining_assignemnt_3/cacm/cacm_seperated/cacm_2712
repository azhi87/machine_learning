horner's rule for the evaluation of general closed queueing networks.wthe solution of separable closed queueing networksrequires the evaluation of homogeneous multinomial expressions.  the number of terms in those expressionsgrows combinatorially with the size of the network such that a direct summation may become impractical.  analgorithm is given which does not show a combinatorial operation count.  the algorithm is based on a generalizationof horner's rule for polynomials.  it is also shown how mean queue size and throughput an be obtainedat negligible extra cost once the normalization constant is evaluated.cacm october, reiser, m.kobayashi, h..kqueueing networks, queueing theory horner's rule,evaluation of multinomial sums, load-dependent service rate.c. . . .ca jb january ,   : am
