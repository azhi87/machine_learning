performance monitoring in a time-sharing system.wa software measurement facility which is part ofa general purpose time-sharing system is described.  the date collection facility (dcf) has been implementedin the michigan terminal system (mts) for the system/ model .  it exists for the purpose of monitoringoperating system and user program behavior and performance.  the overall structure of mts is outlinedin order to explain the implementation of the dcf.  events in the system are identified and recordedfrom within the supervisor, and dumped to magnetic tape by an auxiliary program for off-line processing. events in user programs which are unrelated to system actions are recorded with a supervisor call. the time of occurrence of each event is accurately recorded, and data items are further identified by job andtype.  the overhead associated with data collection and its interference with normal jobs is carefully analyzed,and both are shown to be minimal.  several examples are given of information obtained with thefacility and of applications in which it has been useful.  some general guidelines are offered forthe construction of future monitoring programs.cacm november, pinkerton, t. b..kperformance monitoring, performance measurement,program behavior, performance data, multiprogramming performance, software measurement, time-sharing performance,system evaluation, software monitor, software instrumentation.c. . . . .ca jb february ,   : pm
