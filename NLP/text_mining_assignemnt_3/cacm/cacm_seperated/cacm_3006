anomalies with variable partition paging algorithms.wfive types of anomalous behavior which mayoccur in paged virtual memory operating systems a redefined.  one type of anomaly, for example, concernsthe fact that, with certain reference strings and paging algorithms, an increase in mean memory allocationmay result in an increase in fault rate.  two paging algorithms, are examined in terms of theiranomaly potential, and reference string examples of various anomalies are presented.  two paging algorithmproperties, the inclusion property and the generalized inclusion property, are discussed and theanomaly implications of these properties presented.cacm march, franklin, m.a.graham, g.s.gupta, r.k..kanomaly, memory management, program behavior, stackalgorithms, virtual memory, working set, page fault frequency, paging algorithms.c. . . .ca jb march ,  : pm
