the use of grammatical inference for designing programming languages.wboth in designing a new programming languageand in extending an existing language, the designer is faced with the problem of deriving a "natural" grammarfor the language.  we are proposing an interactive approach to the grammar design problem wherein the designerpresents a sample of sentences and structures as input to a grammatical inference algorithm.  the algorithmthen constructs a grammar which is a reasonable generalization of the examples submitted by the designer. the implementation is presently restricted to a subclass of operator precedence grammars, buta second algorithm is outlined which applies to a larger class of context-free grammars.cacm february, crespi-reghizzi, s.melkanoff, m. a.lichten, l..kgrammar design, language definition, inference,identification in the limit, extensible languages.c. . .ca jb january ,   : pm
