nebula: a digital computer using a  mc glass delay line memory.woregon state university has designed and constructeda medium-speed serial digital computer using glass delay lines circulating at  mc as memory. the design objectives as originally conceived in a special seminar were: () to be a research projectin computer design; () to be usable as an educational machine;and () to have easily modifiable hardware forbasic research in computer systems design.  an unusual arrangement of information within the  mcmemory allows a simple interface with the  kc arithmetic unit, which results in an effective zero latencytime and provides possibilities for an associative memory.  the arithmetic unit has a command structure similarto large parallel machines, and uses flip-flop arithmetic and control registers throughout.  all hardwaredevelopment has been aimed toward the concept of easy modification, elaborate console controls foreffective man-machine interaction and low cost.cacm july, boles, j. a.rux, p. t.weingarten jr., f. w.ca jb march ,   : pm
