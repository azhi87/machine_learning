an example of hierarchical design and proof.whierarchical programming is being increasinglyrecognized as helpful in the construction of large programs.  users of hierarchical techniques claimor predict substantial increases in productivity and in the reliability of the programs produced.  in thispaper we describe a formal method for hierarchical program specification, implementation, and proof.  weapply this method to a significant list processing problem and also discuss a number of extensions to currentprogramming languages that ease hierarchical program design and proof.cacm december, spitzen, j.m.levitt, k.n.robinson, l..kprogram verification, specification, data abstraction,software modules, hierarchical structures.c. . . .ca dh january , : pm
