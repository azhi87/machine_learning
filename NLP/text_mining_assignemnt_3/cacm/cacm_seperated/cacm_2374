a study of storage partitioning using a mathematical model of locality.wboth fixed and dynamic storage partitioningprocedures are examined for use in multiprogramming systems.  the storage requirement of programs is modeledas a stationary gaussian process.  experiments justifying this model are described.  by means of thismodel dynamic storage partitioning is shown to provide substantial increases in storage utilizationand operating efficiency over fixed partitioning. cacm march, coffman jr., e. g.ryan jr., t. a..kstorage partitioning, memory management, dynamicstorage allocation, space sharing, multiprogrammed storage, working-sets, program behavior models, mathematical modeling.c. .ca jb january ,   : pm
