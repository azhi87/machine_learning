degree of multiprogramming in page-on-demand systems.wa simple stochastic model is described whichoffers a base for understanding the relationship between the number of programs permitted to share memory(the degree of multiprogramming), drum traffic rates, and central processing unit utilization in page-on-demand,multiprogrammed, time-shared computer systems.  the model preserves, as a key feature, theproperty of page-demand statistics which implies a "burst" of page demands at the beginning of any jobor quantum execution.  the model, a markov chain, is analyzed numerically and the results are presented graphicallyfor a wide range of key environment-descriptive parameters.  implications of the results to time-sharedsystem design and programming are discussed, and a calculation of the optimal degree of multiprogrammingfor a wide range of parameters is presented graphically. cacm june, wallace, v. l.mason, d. l..kpage-on-demand, demand paging, time-sharing multiprogramming,markovian computer models, scheduling strategies, operating systems, memory management.c. . . . .ca jb february ,   : pm
