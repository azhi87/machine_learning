on the approximate solution of delta(u)=f(u).wthree-dimensional dirichlet problems for delta(u)=f(u),fu >= , are treated numerically by an exceptionally fast, exceptionally accurate numericalmethod.  programming details, numerous examples and mathematical theory are supplied.extension of themethod in a natural way to n-dimensional problems is indicated by means of a -dimensional example.cacm september, greenspan, d.yohe, m.ca jb march ,   : pm
