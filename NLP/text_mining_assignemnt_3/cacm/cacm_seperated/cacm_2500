a practical approach to managing resources and avoiding deadlocks.wresource scheduling and allocation can be expensivewith regard to time and space in multiprogramming or time-sharing environments involving large numbers oftasks and resources with conflicting requirements.  detection and/or prevention of deadlocks can requiremassive amounts of additional overhead if efficient usage of resources is to be maintained.  a resourcemanagement program is described which uses linked lists along with other techniques to overcome a largeportion of this overhead.  the program, which is currently running as part of a large scale general purposeoperating system, keeps resources relatively active but does not detect or prevent all deadlocksin its implemented state.  certain changes, which would permit more comprehensive levels of deadlockprevention/detection at additional cost, have not been incorporated in the running system dueto the infrequency of deadlock situations.cacm may, frailey, d. j..kdeadlock, resource allocation, scheduling, resourcemanagement, multiprogramming, time-sharing, multiprocessing, deadly embrace.c. .ca jb january ,   : pm
