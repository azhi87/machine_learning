computing connected components on parallel computers.wwe present a parallel algorithm which uses n processors to find the connectedcomponents of an undirected graph with n vertices in time o(logn).  ano(logn) time bound also can be achieved using only n$n/$logn)) processors.the algorithm can be used to find the transitive closureof a symmetric boolean matrix.  we assume that the processors haveaccess to a common memory.  simultaneous access to the same locationis permitted for fetch instructions but not for store instructions.cacm august, hirschberg, d.s.chandra, a.k.sarwate, d.v..kgraph theory, parallel processing, algorithms,transitive closure, connected component.c. . .ca db january ,   : pm
