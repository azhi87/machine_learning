improved event-scanning mechanisms for discrete event simulation.wsimulation models of large, complex "real-world"applications have occasionally earned the reputation of eating up hours of computer time.  thisproblem may be attributed in part to difficulties such as slow stochastic convergence.  however, an additionalproblem lies in the fact that a significant amount of bookkeeping time is required to keep future eventsin their proper sequence.  this paper presents a method for significantly reducing the time spent scanningfuture event lists in discrete event simulations.  there models are presented, all of which improve in effectivenessas the events-list scan problem becomes more burdensome.cacm june, wyman, f. p..kdiscrete event simulation, simulation, event scanning mechanisms.c. . .ca jb january ,   : pm
