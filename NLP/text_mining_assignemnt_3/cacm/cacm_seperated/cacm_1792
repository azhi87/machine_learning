exploratory experimental studies comparingonline and off line programming performance.wtwo exploratory experiments were conducted atsystem development corporation to compare debugging performance of programmers working under conditionsof on-line and off line access to a computer.  these are the first known studies that measure programmers'performance under controlled conditions for standard tasks.  statistically significant results of both experimentsindicated faster debugging under online conditions, but perhaps the most important practical findinginvolves the striking individual differences in programmer performance.  methodological problems encounteredin designing and conducting these experiments are described; limitations of the findings are pointedout; hypotheses are presented to account for results; and suggestions are made for further research.cacm january, sackman, h.erikson, w. j.grant, e. e..konline vs. off line performance, programmer/computercommunication, programming experimental-empirical studies, programming cost effectiveness, programmingperformance, debugging effectiveness, time sharing vs. batch processing, factor analysis application,programmer trainee performance, basic programming knowledge test, experienced programmer study, analysisof variance, programmer individual differences.c.ca jb february ,   : pm
