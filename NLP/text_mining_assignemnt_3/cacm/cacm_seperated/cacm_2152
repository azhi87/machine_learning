display procedures.walthough the use of structured display filesis widespread in interactive computer graphics, these structures present a number of problems whichtend to restrict their generality and usefulness.  this paper discusses some of these problems, and suggests analternative approach to display system design which avoids the use of structured display files. this technique employs display procedures to generate information for display.  by including transformationswithin calls to these procedures it is possible both to simplify the specification of picturesand to speed up their generation.  display procedures permit picture elements to be defined conditionallyand also facilitate the processing of inputs from pointing devices.  the paper is illustrated by examplesfrom aversion of the euler language in which display procedures were implemented.cacm october, newman, w. m..kcomputer graphics, programming languages, display files.c. .ca jb february ,   : pm
