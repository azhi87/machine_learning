operations on sparse relations.wvarious computations on relations, boolean matrices,or directed graphs, such as the computation of precedence relations for a context-free grammar, can bedone by a practical algorithm that is asymptotically faster than those in common use.  for example, how to computeoperator precedence or wirth-weber precedence relations in o(n^) steps is shown, as well as how tocompute linear precedence functions in o(n^) steps is shown, as well as how to compute linear precedencefunctions in o(n) steps, where n is the size of a grammer.  the heart of the algorithms is a generaltheorem giving sufficient conditions under which an expression whose operands are sparse relations andwhose operators are composition, transitive closure, union, and inverse, can be computed efficiently.cacm march, hunt, h. b. iiiszymanski, t. g.ullman, j. d..kcomputational complexity, sparse relation, booleanmatrix, directed graph, wirth-weber precedence relation, linear precedence function, slrgrammar, t-canonical precedence relation.c. . .ca jb december ,   : am
