computation of page fault probability from program transition diagram.wan algorithm is given for calculating page faultprobability in a virtual memory system operating under demand paging with various memory sizes and replacementrules.  a first order markov model of program behavior is assumed, and a representation of the systembased on memory states, control states, and memory substates is presented.  the algorithm is general inthe sense that the page fault probabilities can be calculated for nonpredictive replacement rules appliedto any program represented by a one-step markov chain.  a detailed example is given to illustrate thealgorithm for random and least recently used (lru) replacement rules.cacm april, franklin, m. a.gupta, r. k..kvirtual memory, demand paging, replacement rule,program model, program behavior, markov model, page fault, page fault probability.c. .ca jb january ,   : am
