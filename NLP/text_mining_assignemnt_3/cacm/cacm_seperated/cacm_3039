on-the-fly garbage collection: an exercise in cooperation.was an example of cooperation between sequentialprocesses with very little mutual interference despite frequent manipulations of a large shared dataspace,  a technique is developed which allows nearly all of the activity needed for garbage detection and collectionto be performed by an additional processor operating con-currently with the processor devoted to thecomputation proper.  exclusion and synchronization constraints have been kept as weak as could be achieved;the severe complexities engendered by doing so are illustrated. cacm november, dijkstra, e.w.lamport, l.martin, a.j.scholten, c.s.steffens, e.f.m..kmultiprocessing, fine-grained interleaving, cooperationbetween sequential processes with minimized mutual exclusion, program correctness for multiprogrammingtasks, garbage collection .c. . . . .ca dh january ,   : pm
