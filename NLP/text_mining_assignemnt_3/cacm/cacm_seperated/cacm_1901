dynamic space-sharing in computer systems.wa formalization of relationships between space-shadingprogram behavior, and processor efficiency in computer systems is presented.  concepts of value andcost of space allocation per task are defined and then value and cost are combined to develop a singleparameter termed value per unit cost.  the intent is to illustrate a possible analytic approach to theinvestigation of the problems of space-sharing and to demonstrate the method on sample problems.cacm may, belady, l. a.kuehner, c. j..kspace-sharing, storage allocation, memory allocation,storage management, memory management, program behavior, multiprogramming, computer system design, allocationstrategies, replacement strategies, demand-paging, time-sharing.c. . .ca jb february ,   : pm
