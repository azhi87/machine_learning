syntax-directed least-errors analysis forcontext-free languages: a practical approach.wa least-errors recognizer is developed informallyusing the well-known recognizer of earley, along with elements of bellman's dynamic programming. the analyzer takes a general class of context-free grammars as drivers, and any finite string as input. recognition consists of a least-errors count for a corrected version of the input relative to the drivergrammar. the algorithm design emphasizes practical aspects which help in programming it.cacm january, lyon, g..karbitrary input strings, context-free grammars,parsing, dynamic programming, stored subanalyses, separability, state merging, least-errors correction.c. . .ca jb january ,    : pm
