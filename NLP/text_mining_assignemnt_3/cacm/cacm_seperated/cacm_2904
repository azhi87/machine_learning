an algorithm for reduction of operator strength.wa simple algorithm which uses an indexed temporarytable to perform reduction of operator strength in strongly connected regions is presented.  several extensions,including linear function test replacement, are discussed.  these algorithms should fit well into anintegrated package of local optimization algorithms.cacm november, cocke, j..kcompilers, optimization of compiled code, program analysis,operator strength reduction, test replacement, strongly connected region.c. . .ca jb december ,   : am
