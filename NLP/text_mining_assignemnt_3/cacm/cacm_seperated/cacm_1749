the structure of the "the"-multiprogramming system.wa multiprogramming system is described inwhich all activities are divided over a number of sequential processes.  these sequential processes are placedat various hierarchical levels, in each of which one or more independent abstractions have beenimplemented.  the hierarchical structure proved to be vital for the verification of the logical soundnessof the design and the correctness of its implementation.cacm may, dijkstra, e. w..koperating system, multiprogramming system, systemhierarchy, system structure, real-time debugging, program verification, synchronizing primitives, cooperatingsequential processes, system levels, input-output buffering, multiprogramming, processor sharing, multiprocessing.c. .ca jb february ,   : am
