counting large numbers of events in small registers.wit is possible to use a small counter to keepapproximate counts of large numbers.  the resulting expected error can be rather precisely controlled.  anexample is given in which -bit counters (bytes) are used to keep track of as many as , events witha relative error which is substantially independent of the number n of events.  this relative error canbe expected to be  percent or less  percent of the time (i.e.o = n/).  the techniques could be usedto advantage in multichannel counting hardware or software used for the monitoring of experiments or processes.cacm october, morris, r..kcounting.c.ca dh january ,   : pm
