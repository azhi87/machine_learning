petri nets and speed independent design.wpetri nets are investigated as one method ofmodeling speed independent asynchronous circuits.  a study of circuit realizations of petri nets leadsto a demonstration of their usefulness in modeling speed independent operation.  this usefulness is emphasizedby the design of a speed independent processor from modules developed in the investigation of petri net implementation.cacm august, misunas, d..kspeed independent asynchronous, petri net.c. .ca jb january ,   : am
