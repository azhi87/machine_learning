connections between accuracy and stabilityproperties of linear multistep formulas.wthis paper is concerned with stability and accuracyof families of linear k-step formulas depending on parameters, with particular emphasis on the numericalsolution of stiff ordinary differential equations.  an upper bound, p=k, is derived for the order of accuracyof a(inf)-stable formulas.  three criteria are given for a()-stability.  it is shown that () forp=k, k arbitrary, a(inf)-stability implies certain necessary conditions for a()-stability and for strictstability (meaning that the extraneous roots of p(psi) satisfy |psi|<); () for p=k=,,,and , a(inf)-stability(for k= together with another constraint) implies strict stability; and () for certain one-parameterclasses of formulas with p=k=,,and/or , a(inf)-stability implies a()-stability.cacm january, liniger, w..kstiff equations, parametrized linear multistep formulas,order of accuracy, a()-stability, a(inf)-stability, strict stability.c.ca jb january ,   : am
