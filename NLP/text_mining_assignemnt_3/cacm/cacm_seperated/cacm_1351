automatic error bounds on real zeros of rational functions.wa procedure for implementing an interval arithmeticversion of the newton-raphson method is proposed.  the procedure require only a starting intervalover which the zeros of a given rational function are to be located.  the method automatically provides bounds for roundoff error.cacm november, dargel, r. h.loscalzo, f. r.witt, t. h.ca jb march ,   : pm
