general equations for idealized cpu-i/o overlap configurations.wgeneral equations are derived for estimatingthe maximum possible utilization of main storage partitions, cpu and i/o devices under different conditionsin an idealized cpu-i/o overlap model of multiprogrammed computer systems.  the equations are directly applicableto any configuration consisting  of sets of identical cpu's i/o processors, main storage partitionsand user tasks.  examples are provided to illustrate the use of the equations to compute effective processingtime per record and expected timesharing response time under both balanced and unbalanced resource utilization conditions. cacm june, teory, t.j..kblocking, buffering, input/output, overlap, performance,resource allocation, throughput, timesharing.c. . . .ca dh february ,   : pm
