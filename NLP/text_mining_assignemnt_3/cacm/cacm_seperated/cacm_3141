an improved algorithm for decentralized extrema-findingin circular configurations of processes.wthis note presents an improvement to lelann'salgorithm for finding the largest (or smallest) of a set of uniquelynumbered processes arranged in a circle, in which no centralcontroller exists and the number of processes is not known a priori.this decentralized algorithm uses a technique of selectivemessage extinction in order to achieve an average number ofmessage passes of order (n log n) rather than o(n).  cacm may, chang, e.roberts, r..kdecentralized algorithms, distributed systems, operating systems.c. . . .ca dh june ,   : pm
