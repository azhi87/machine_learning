a queuing model of a multiprogrammedcomputer with a two-level storage system.wthe results are presented of an analysis ofa probabilistic model of a multiprogrammed computer system with a two-level storage system in which thereis sequential dependency of accesses between the devices.  expressions are obtained for the long-run probabilitythat both the cpu and each of the storage devices are busy.  some numerical results are given whichquantify the gains in cpu utilization obtainable by multiprogramming in the presence of this type of storage system.cacm january, shedler, g. s..kmultiprogrammed computer system, storage system, hierarchical index sets.c.ca jb january ,   : pm
