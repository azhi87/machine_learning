interactive skeleton techniques for enhancingmotion dynamics in key frame animation.wa significant increase in the capability forcontrolling motion dynamics in key frame animation is achieved through skeleton control.  this techniqueallows an animator to develop a complex motion sequence by animating a stick figure representationof an image.  this control sequence is then used to drive an image sequence through the same movement. the simplicity of the stick figure image encourages a high level of interaction during the design stage. its compatibility with the basic key frame animation technique permits skeleton control to be applied selectivelyto only those components of a composite image sequence that require enhancement.cacm october, burtnyk, n.wein, m..kinteractive graphics, computer generated animation,key frame animation, interactive skeleton control, stick figure animation.c. . . .ca jb january ,   : pm
