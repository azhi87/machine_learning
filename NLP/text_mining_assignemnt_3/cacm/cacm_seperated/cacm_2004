a procedure for generation of three-dimensionalhalf-toned computer graphics presentations.wa description is given of an algorithm for producing computer generated half-tone presentations of three-dimensional polygonal surface structures.  this algorithm achieves a significant increase in speed of computation over the warnock algorithm developed at the university of utah and implementedalso on the coordinated science laboratory cdc  computersystem at the university of illinois.  the history leading to the algorithmdevelopment and then the algorithm itself are described.results are presented and are compared with computer runs achievedby the warnock approach.  an extension of the procedure to variable positionillumination sources is also given.cacm september, bouknight, w. j..khalf-tone computer graphics, line-scan image processing,hidden surface, polygonal surface structure presentations.c.ca jb february ,   : pm
