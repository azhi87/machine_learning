dad, the c.s.i.r.o. operating system.wthe design and implementation of the c.s.i.r.o.operating system, dad, is described in detail.  this system is designed for the control data  usinga large drum backing store and is intended to allow the integration of a remote console (display) subsysteminto a conventional job stack environment.  the use of the drums, the buffering of input and outputon slow peripherals, and the execution of normal job stack work are described.  the display subsystemis described only as it integrates into the rest of the system.  the techniques found useful in the developmentof dad are given, and an assessment is made of the validity of various design decisions.  performancefigures based on several months of operation are tabulated.cacm september, austin, b. j.holden, t. s.hudson, r. h.ca jb february ,   : pm
