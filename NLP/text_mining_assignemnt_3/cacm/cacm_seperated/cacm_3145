an implementation of structured walk-throughsin teaching cobol programming.wthe effectiveness of structuredwalk-throughs in teaching introductory cobol programming was empiricallyassessed with a sample of  under-graduate business administrationmajors.  cobol proficiency was measured by a final examinationtesting (a) knowledge of language rules, (b) ability to readand debug a program, and (c) the ability to write a program.  analysisof multiple covariance was used to statistically adjust testscores for age and conditional reasoning scores. the findings provideempirical support for incorporating structured walk-throughsinto the programming learning process more effectivelydevelop student proficiency in writing cobol programs.cacm june, lemos, r.s..kstructured walk-throughs, cobol programming, teachingof programming, testing programming proficiency.c. . . .ca dh august ,  : pm
