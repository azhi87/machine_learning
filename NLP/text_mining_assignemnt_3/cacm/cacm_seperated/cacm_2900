some theorems to aid in solving the file allocation problem.wthe file allocation problem-i.e. the problemof finding the optimal set of network sites at which to locate copies of a file-is known to be, in general,polynomial complete.  heuristics and other aids to finding optimal, or near-optimal, solutions aretherefore much needed.  in this paper we present three theorems which can be applied a priori to indicatethat certain sites should (or should not) be included in an optimal allocation.cacm november, grapa, e.belford, g. g..kfile allocation, computer networks, distributed data management.c.ca jb december ,   : am
