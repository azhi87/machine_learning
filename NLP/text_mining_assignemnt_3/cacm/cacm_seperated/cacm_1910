an algorithm for solving a special classof tridiagonal systems of linear equations.wan algorithm is presented for solving a systemof linear equation bu=k where b is tridiagonal and of a special form.  it is shown that this algorithmis almost twice as fast as the gaussian elimination method usually suggested for solving such systems. in addition, explicit formulas for the inverse and determinant of the matrix b are given.cacm april, rose, d. j..ktridiagonal, gaussian elimination, central difference.c. .ca jb february ,   : pm
