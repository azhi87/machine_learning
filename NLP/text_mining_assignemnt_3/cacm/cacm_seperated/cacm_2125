a note on minimal length polygonal approximation to a digitized contour.wa method for extracting a smooth polygonalcontour from a digitized image is illustrated.the ordered sequence of contour points and the connection graph ofthe image are first obtained by a modified ledley algorithm in oneimage scan.  a minimal perimeter polygon subjected to specified constraintsis then chosen as the approximating contour.  the determination of the minimal polygon can be reduced to a nonlinear programmingproblem, solved by an algorithm which takes into accountthe weak bonds between variables.  some examples are presented,and the corresponding computing times are listed.cacm january, montanari, u..kdigitized image, connection tree, minimal polygon,optimal approximation, nonlinear programming.c. . .ca jb february ,   : pm
