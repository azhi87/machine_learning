a note on compiling fixed point binary multiplications.wan algorithm is developed for compiling, asa sequence of shifts, additions,and subtractions, many fixed point binary multiplications involving aconstant.  the most significant characteristics of the algorithm are the simplicity of the test whichdetermines if the algorithm should be applied and the degree to which it "suggests" efficient object code.cacm june, glaswin, h. t..kcompiling multiplications, fixed point arithmetic.c.ca jb february ,   : am
