dynamic computation of derivatives.wit is shown how wengert's procedure for computationof derivatives can be implemented conveniently by use of compiler-generated complex addition, subtraction,and linkage to complex arithmetic subroutines. evaluation of a function and derivative proceed inparallel, as in wengert's procedure, but with the "imaginary" parts of variables declared complex bearingthe values of the derivatives of the real parts.  this technique provides a simple way to compute thederivatives of a function, without the need for deriving and programming the evaluation ofexplicit formulas for the derivatives.cacm september, lesk, a. m.ca jb february ,   : pm
