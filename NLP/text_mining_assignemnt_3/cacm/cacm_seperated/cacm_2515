minimal event-node network of project precedence relations.wa procedure for constructing a minimal event-nodenetwork to represent a set of precedence relations without parallel activities is presented.  aminimal event-node network is an event-node network in which both the number of nodes and the number of arcsare the minima to preserve the given precedence relations counterexamples are given to show that thealgorithm presented by a. c. fisher, j. s. liebman, and g. l. nemhauser () produces event-node networkswhich are not minimal.  since our procedure includes the set-covering problem, the time required may growexponentially with the number of given activities.cacm may, corneil, d. g.gotlieb, c. c.lee, y. m..knetwork, project, event-node network, activity-nodenetwork, minimal event-node network, dummy activity, project precedence relations.c. . .ca jb january ,   : am
