architecture of the ibm system/.wthis paper discusses the design considerationsfor the architectural extensions that distinguish system/ from system/.  it comments on some experienceswith the original objectives for system/ and on the efforts to achieve them, and it describes thereasons and objectives for extending the architecture. it covers virtual storage, program control, data-manipulationinstructions, timing facilities, multiprocessing, debugging and monitoring, error handling, and input/outputoperations.  a final section tabulates some of the important parameters of the various ibmmachines which implement the architecture.cacm january, case, r.p.padges, a..kcomputer systems, architecture, instructionsets, virtual storage, error handling.c. .ca jb march ,   : pm
