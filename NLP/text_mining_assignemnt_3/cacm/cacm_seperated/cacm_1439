mechanization of the curve fitting process: datan.wa process for fitting a curve to approximate dataand the problem it creates for the engineer-programmer is defined.  an approach has also been defined and a systemhas been written for the sru  to mechanize a major portion of this process.  the techniques developedto accomplish the mechanization are largely empirical, and are dependent for their informationonly on the actual data points.cacm april, simonsen, r. h.anketell, d. l.ca jb march ,   : am
