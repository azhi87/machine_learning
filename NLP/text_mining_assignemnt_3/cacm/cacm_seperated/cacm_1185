a program to solve the pentomino problem by the recursive use of macros.wa coding technique is described in which certainmacro-instructions are given lists as arguments and are thereby used recursively.  the discussion coversprimarily an example in which the technique is used to solve the pentomino problem-the problem offitting  pentominos without overlapping into a plane area formed of  elemental squares.cacm october, fletcher, j. g.ca jb march ,   : pm
