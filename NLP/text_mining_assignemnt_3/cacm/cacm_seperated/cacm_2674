scan conversion algorithms for a cell organized raster display.wraster scan computer graphics with "real time"character generators have previously been limited to alphanumeric characters.  a display has been describedwhich extends the capabilities of this organization to include general graphics.  two fundamentally differentscan conversion algorithms which have been developed to support this display are presented.  oneis most suitable to non-interactive applications and the other to interactive applications.  the algorithmswere implemented in fortran on the cdc  computer.  results obtained from the implementations showthat the noninteractive algorithms can significantly reduce display file storage requirements at little costin execution time over that of a conventional raster display.  the interactive algorithm can improveresponse time and reduce storage requirements.cacm march, barrett, r. c.fordan, b. w. jr..kgraphics, scan conversion, raster display, linedrawing, discrete image, dot generation, matrixdisplays.c. . .ca jb january ,   : am
