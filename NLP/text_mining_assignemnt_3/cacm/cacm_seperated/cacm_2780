on computing certain elements of the inverse of a sparse matrix.wa recursive algorithm for computing the inverseof a matrix from the lu factors based on relationships in takahashi, et al., is examined.  the formulas for thealgorithm are given; the dependency relationships are derived; the computational costs are developed; and somegeneral comments on application and stability are made.cacm march, erisman, e. m.tinney, w. f..ksparse matrices, triangular factorization, elementsof inverse, tridiagonal matrix, sensitivities.c. .ca jb january ,   : pm
