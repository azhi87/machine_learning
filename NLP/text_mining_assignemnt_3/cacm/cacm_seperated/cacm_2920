game interpretation of the deadlock avoidance problem.wthe deadlock avoidance problem may be definedinformally as the determination, from some a priori information about the processes, resources, operatingsystem, etc., of the "safe situations" which may be realized without endangering the smooth runningof the system.  when each process specifies its future needs by a flowchart of need-defined steps, a globalapproach to the phenomenon and its in terpretation as a game between the operating system and the processesallows formalization of risk and safety concepts.  the bipartite graph representation of this game maythen be used to construct explicitly the set of safe states and to study their properties.cacm october, devillers, r..koperating system, multiprogramming, time-sharing,resource allocation, deadlock, in terlock, deadly embrace, deadlock avoidance, flowchart.c. .ca jb december ,   : am
