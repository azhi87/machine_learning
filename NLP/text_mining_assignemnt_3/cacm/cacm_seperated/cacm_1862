computing capabilities at argentine and chilean universities.wthe author reports on a trip to universities inargentina and chile during november , describing university conditions and computing activities.  as elsewhere,these universities are experiencing student discontent with the status quo and the solutions theyare attempting contrast: argentina is excluding students from participating in university government;chile is allowing such participation.  university computing service and academic activities are limited. the number of computers is small and so is the capacity, none larger than an ibm /; with someexception, computing science academic programs are rare. this situation is by no means attributable tothose responsible for computing developments, who strive for excellence; rather the "system" is hard toover-come.  universities, especially those with strong european traditions, adapt slowly to new academicresources and disciplines; superimposed are the severe technological and economic constraints of thedeveloping nation.  consequently, in the absence of conscious government emphasis on strengthening computingcapabilities, future progress may be retarded.cacm august, finerman, a..kuniversity education, computing science academicprograms, university computing centers, surveys of computing centers, university computing capabilities, university-studentrelationship, argentine universities, chilean universities, south american universities, developing nations.c. . .ca jb february ,   : pm
