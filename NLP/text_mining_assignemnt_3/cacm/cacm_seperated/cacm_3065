right brother trees.winsertion and deletion are provided for theclass of right (or one-sided) brother trees which have o (log n) performance.  the importance of theseresults stems from the close relationship of right brother trees which have an insertion algorithm operatingin o (log n).  further, although both insertion and deletion can be  carried out in o (log n) time forright brother trees, it appears that the insertion algorithm is inherently much more difficult than thedeletion algorithm-the reverse of what one usually obtains.  cacm september, ottmann, t.t.six, h.w.wood, d..kdictionary problem, search trees, avl trees, brothertrees, right-balanced trees,one-sided height-balanced trees, insertion and deletion algorithms.c. . .ca dh january ,  : pm
