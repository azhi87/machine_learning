writing an outline debugging program for the experienced user.wpresently available online debugging routinesare often unsatisfactory for the experienced user because they require unnecessarily rigid and complicatedtyping formats, make it difficult for the user to correct typing errors, and consume excessivememory with intricate features.  in a debugging program it is of prime importance that the programbe simple, flexible, and highly efficient to use.  communication between the user and the debugging programcan be improved by using certain techniques applicable to most online debugging programs.  thesetechniques are presented and are illustrated by their use in opak (octal package), a debugging program codedfor the pdp-/ and the sds-.  the compromise between economy of utility program core storage and incorporationof elegant debugging features is discussed.cacm june, brady, p. t..kdebugging, utility program, programming languages.c.ca jb february ,   : pm
