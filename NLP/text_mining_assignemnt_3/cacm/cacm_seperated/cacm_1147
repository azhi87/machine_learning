on the numerical solution of boundary value problemsfor linear ordinary differential equations*.wa numerical method is presented for the solutionof boundary value problems involving linear ordinary differential equations.  the method describedis noniterative and makes use of any one-step numerical integration scheme to reduce the problem fromone of boundary values to one of initial values.  comments are made concerning some numerical resultsof applying the method to a specific problem.  in addition an extension of the algorithm describedto more general problems is discussed.cacm january, day, j. t.collins ii, g. w.ca jb march ,   : am
