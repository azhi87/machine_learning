gpl, a truly general purpose language.wa truly general purpose programming language,gpl, is described which contains facilities for constructing (within the language) new data types aswell as facilities for operations performed upon them.  the basic language is minimal in the sense thatno basic element can be derived from the others with high efficiency in the object programs.  constructslike the algol  for-statements,and if-statements are not basic; they are special types of procedures. new "symbols" (underlined words in algol ) are implicitly defined by usage in other declarations.  aspart words are definable, packed words are handled as easily as full words.  "address" variables(pointers) are included in full generality.cacm september, garwick, j. v..kprogramming language, general purpose, self-extending, macro, algol.c.ca jb february ,   : am
