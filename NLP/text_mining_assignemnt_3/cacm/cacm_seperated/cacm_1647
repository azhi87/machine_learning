watfor-the university of waterloo fortran iv compiler.wwatfor is an in-core, load-and-go compilerwhich has been implemented within the ibm / operating system.  fortran iv was selected as the sourcelanguage in order to achieve maximum language compatibility with other available compiling systems,in particular the ibm / fortran iv system.  the principal advantage of the watfor compiler is thatit translates fortran iv programs at speeds of up to  statements per second.  since the compilerresides core there is virtually no system overhead, and hence large batches of "student" programs may be processed veryefficiently.  the compiler also provides extensive error diagnostics, during both the compilationand the execution phases of a program run.  this feature makes the system attractive toboth learners and learned users alike.cacm january, shantz, p. w.german, r. a.mitchell, j. g.ca jb february ,   : pm
