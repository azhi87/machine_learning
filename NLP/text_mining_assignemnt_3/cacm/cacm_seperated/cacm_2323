toward a general theory of special functions.wa list of a number of natural developmentsfor the field of algebraic manipulation is given.  then the prospects for a general theory of functionsdefined by ordinary differential equations are discussed.  the claim is made that recent developmentsin mathematics indicate that it should be possible to algorithmically generate many properties of solutionsto differential equations.  such a theory is preferable to a less general effort to make algebraicmanipulation systems knowledgeable about the usual special functions (e.g. exponential, hypergeometric).cacm july, moses, j..kalgebraic manipulation, special functions, algebraicsimplification, symbolic integration, algebraic geometry, differential algebra.c. . . .ca jb january ,   : pm
