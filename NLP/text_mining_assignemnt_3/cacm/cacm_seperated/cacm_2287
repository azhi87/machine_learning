a new approach to automatic scanning of contour maps.wthe problem of automatic digitizing of contourmaps is discussed.  the structure of a general contour map is analyzed, and its topological propertiesare utilized in developing a new scanning algorithm.  the problem of detection and recognition of contourlines is solved by a two color labeling method.  it is shown that for maps containing normal contour linesonly, it suffices to distinguish between so-called "even" and "odd" lines.  the "tangency problem" involvedin practical scanning is discussed, and a solution based on minimizing computer memory space andsimplifying control program is suggested.cacm september, mor, m.lamdan, t..kautomatic scanning, contour maps, digitizing,contour lines, topology, detection and recognition.c. . . .ca jb january ,   : pm
