multiprogram scheduling parts  and .  introduction and theory*.win order to exploit fully a fast computer whichpossesses simultaneous processing abilities, it should to a large extent schedule its own workload. the scheduling routine must be capable of extremely rapid execution if it is not to prove self-defeating. the construction of a schedule entails determining which programs are to be run concurrently and which sequentiallywith respect to each other.  a concise scheduling algorithm is described which tends to minimizethe time for executing the entire pending workload (or any subset of it), subject to external constraintssuch as precedence, urgency, etc.  the algorithm is applicable to a wide class of machines.cacm june, codd, e. f.ca jb march ,   : pm
