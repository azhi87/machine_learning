levels of computer systems.win building current computer systems, we tendto break them down into "levels" of control, command and communication; in using the system, we breakour problems down correspondingly.  the continued use of such a structure raises questions about its effectson the usefulness of future systems, particularly with regard to such trends as time sharing, parallelprogramming, and, eventually, systems which learn.  in this essay some of these questions are posed, andthe general attitude we must take in pursuing the problem further is discussed.cacm december, bryant, p.ca jb march ,   : pm
