remote, on-line, real-time computer diagnosisof the clinical electrocardiogram.wpresented in this paper is a brief report onthe hardware, software, system configuration and function of a system for the remote, online, real-time digitalcomputer diagnosis of clinical electrocardiograms.  it seems likely that efforts of this sort will leadto a satisfactory solution to the problem of the automatic diagnosis of electrocardiograms.  currentattempts by the authors to extend the diagnostic capabilities of the present system are particularly concernedwith increasing the fidelity of the adaptive matched filters, the development of three dimensional pattern analysis,the analysis of parallel electrocardiographer-computer diagnostic interaction, and a study of the possibilityof introducing major, tree-like branching decisions early in the diagnostic process.cacm january, whipple, g. h.dickson, j. f.horibe, h.stark, l.ca jb march ,   : pm
