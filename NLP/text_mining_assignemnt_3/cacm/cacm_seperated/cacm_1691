a comparison of the correlational behaviorof random number generators for the ibm .whutchinson states that the "new" (prime modulo)multiplicative congruential pseudorandom generator, attributed to d. h. lehmer, has passed the usual statisticaltests for random number generators.  it is here empirically shown that generators of this typecan produce sequences whose autocorrelation functions up to lag  exhibit evidence of nonrandomness for manymultiplicative constants.  an alternative generator proposed by tausworthe, which uses irreducible polynomialsover the field of characteristic two, is shown to be free from this defect.  the applicability of thesetwo generators to the ibm  is then discussed.  since computer word size can affect a generator's statisticalbehavior the older mixed and simple congruential generators, although extensively tested on computershaving  or more bits per word, may not be optimum generators for the ibm .cacm september, whittlesey, j. r..krandom numbers, pseudorandom number generators, autocorrelationfunction, serial correlation, digital shift-register generators, linear recurrence modulotwo, irreducible polynomials, primitive trinomials modulo two, congruential generators, prime numbers,statistical tests for randomness, ibm , -bit versus -bit word size.c.ca jb february ,   : pm
