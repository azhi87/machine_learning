computer generation of gamma random variables - ii.wa rejection method is proposed for generatinggamma variates with nonintegral shape parameter a, a > . this method is similar to other methods givenby fishman, wallace, and tadikamalla and is faster than these methods for a> .  the core storage requirementsand the programming effort for the proposed method are similar to those of wallace's or tadikamalla'smethods.  the computational times for the proposed method remain fairly constant for medium and largevalues of a and are superior to times obtained by ahrens and dieter's method for all values of a.  theproposed method is simpler than ahrens and dieter's method.cacm november, tadikamalla, p.r..kgamma variables, rejection method, computer methods.c. .ca dh january ,   : am
