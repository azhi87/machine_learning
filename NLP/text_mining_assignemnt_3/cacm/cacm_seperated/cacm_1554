a computer technique for displaying n-dimensional hyperobjects.wa digital computer and automatic plotter havebeen used to generate three-dimensional stereoscopic movies of the three-dimensional parallel and perspectiveprojections of four-dimensional hyperobjects rotating in four-dimensional space.  the observed projectionsand their motions were a direct extensionof three-dimensional experience, but no profound "feeling"or insight into the fourth spatial dimension was obtained.  the technique can be generalized to n-dimensionsand applied to any n-dimensional hyperobject or hypersurface.cacm august, noll, a. m.ca jb february ,   : pm
