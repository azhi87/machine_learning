proof of a program: find.wa proof is given of the correctness of thealgorithm "find."  first, a informal description is given of the purpose of the program and the methodused.  a systematic technique is described for constructing the program proof during the process of codingit, in such a way as to prevent the intrusion of logical errors.  the proof of termination is treatedas a separate exercise.  finally, some conclusions relating to general programming methodology are drawn.cacm january, hoare, c. a. r..kproofs of programs, programming methodology, programdocumentation, program correctness, theory of programming.c. . . . .ca jb february ,   : am
