an interactive graphical display monitor ina batch-processing environment with remote entry.wa graphic monitor program is described.  itwas developed at carnegie-mellon university for the cdc g computer, which is a general purpose, batch-processingsystem with remote entry.  the existing g system and the graphics hardware are described. the graphic monitor is a resident auxiliary monitor which provides comprehensive managerial capabilityover the graphical system in response to commands from the human user.  it also will respond to commandsfrom a user program through a similar interface, where routine calls take the place of manual actions.  thusthe human and program can interact on a symmetrical and equal basis through the medium of the graphic monitor. the choice made in designing the graphic monitor, given the constraints of the existing hardwareand computer system, are discussed.  the structure of the monitor program and the human and program interfacesare described.  there is also a transient swapping version with a small resident part,and provision for swapped used submonitors.cacm november, bond, a. h.rightnour, j..kgraphic monitor, man/machine interaction, graphicinterface, graphic in batch environment, design of graphical system.c. . . .ca jb february ,   : pm
