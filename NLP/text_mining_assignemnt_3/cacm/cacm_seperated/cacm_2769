a modification of warshall's algorithm forthe transitive closure of binary relations.wan algorithm is given for computing the transitiveclosure of a binary relation that is represented by a boolean matrix. the algorithm is similar to warshall'salthough it executes faster for sparse matriceson most computers, particularly in a paging environment.cacm april, warren, h. s. jr..kwarshall's algorithm, transitive closure, reachabilitymatrix, directed graph, digraph, boolean matrix, binary relation.c. .ca jb january ,   : pm
