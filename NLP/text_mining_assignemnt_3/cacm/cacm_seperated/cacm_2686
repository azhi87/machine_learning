an approximate method for generating asymmetric random variables.wtukey's lambda distribution is generalizedto provide an algorithm for generating values of unimodal asymmetric random variables.  this algorithmhas the same advantages as the symmetric random variable generator previously given by the authors, exceptthat the addition of another parameter complicatesthe problem of finding the parameter values to fit a distribution.cacm february, ramberg, j. s.schmeiser,b. w..ksimulation, monte carlo, probability, statistics,approximations, random variables, random numbers, moments, distribution.c. .ca jb january ,   : pm
