optimal conversion of extended-entrydecision tables with general cost criteria.wa general dynamic programming algorithm for convertinglimited, extended, or mixed entry decision tables to optimal decision trees is presented which cantake into account rule frequencies or probabilities, minimum time and/or space cost criteria, common actionsets, compressed rules and else rules, sequencing constraints on condition tests, excludable combinationsof conditions, certain ambiguities, and interrupted rule masking. cacm april, lew, a..kdecision table, optimal programs, dynamic programming.c. . . . . . .ca dh february ,   : pm
