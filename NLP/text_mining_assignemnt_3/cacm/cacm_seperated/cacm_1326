boundary networks.wa feasible computer procedure is describedfor determining the total or partial inclusion of arbitrarily given points and lines with respect to aset of general polygonal domains which partition a plane bounded region.  a scheme for the computer representationof the boundaries of the domains and an algorithm, based on this  scheme, for evaluatingthe inclusion relations are specified in detail.  the method employs several levels of selection criteriafor the purpose of reducing the number of accesses to auxiliary storage devices and the amount of boundarydata for which processing is required.cacm january, loomis, r. g.ca jb march ,   : pm
