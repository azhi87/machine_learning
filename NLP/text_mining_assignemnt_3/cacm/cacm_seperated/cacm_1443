a method for finding the least squares estimateof the intersection point of two helices in space.wwhen the helical trajectories of two chargedparticles moving away from a common point in a magnetic field are reconstructed from measurements onthe tracks, the reconstructed tracks are perturbed by measurement and other errors and do not, in general,intersect.  a method is given for adjusting the reconstructed tracks in a least squares manner so that they do intersect.cacm april, royston, r. j.gregory, j.ca jb march ,   : am
