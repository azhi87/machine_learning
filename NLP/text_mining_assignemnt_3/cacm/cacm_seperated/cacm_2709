a genealogy of control structures.wthe issue of program control structures hashad a history of heated controversy.  to put this issue on a solid footing, this paper reviews numerous theoreticalresults on control structures and explores their practical implications.  the classic result ofbohm and jacopini on the theoretical completeness of if-then-else and while-do is discussed. several recentideas on control structures are then explored.  these include a review of various other control structures,results on time/space limitations, and theorems relating the relative power of control structures undernotions of equivalence.  in conclusion, the impact of theoretical results on the practicing programmer andthe importance of one-in, one-out control structures as operational abstractions are discussed.  it is arguedfurther that there is insufficient evidence to warrant more than if-then-else, while-do, and their variants.cacm november, ledgard, h. f.marcotty, m..kstructured programming, control structures,goto statements, language design, pascal.c. .ca jb january ,   : am
