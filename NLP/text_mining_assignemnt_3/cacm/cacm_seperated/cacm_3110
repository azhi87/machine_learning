assembling code for machines with span-dependent instructions.wmany modern computers contain instructionswhose lengths depend on the distance from a given instance of such an instruction to the operand of thatinstruction.  this paper considers the problem of minimizing the lengths of programs for such machines. an efficient solution is presented for the case in which the operand of every such "span-dependent"instruction is either a label or an assembly-time expression of a certain restricted form.if this restrictionis relaxed by allowing these operands to be more general assembly-time expressions, thenthe problem is shown to be np-complete.cacm april, szymanski, t.g..kspan-dependent instructions, variable-length addressing,code generation, assemblers, compilers, np-complete, computational complexity..c. . .ca dh february ,   : pm
