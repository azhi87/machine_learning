an extended arithmetic package.win many fields, for example algebraic numbertheory, arithmetic must be carried out to a degree of precision which exceeds the normal hardware capacityof most machines.  in such cases, an extended arithmetic package provides a comprehensive and easy-to-useway of performing such arithmetic.  such a package was coded for the ibm .  in discussingthe general problems associated with the design of an extended arithmetic package, specific reference is made to this program.cacm may, blum, b. i.ca jb march ,   : pm
