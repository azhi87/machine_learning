a note on reliable full-duplex transmission over half-duplex links.wa simple procedure for achieving reliable full-duplextransmission over half-duplex links is proposed. the scheme is compared with another of thesame type, which has recently been described in the literature.  finally, some comments are made onanother group of related transmission procedures which have been shown to be unreliable under some circumstances.cacm may, bartlett, k. a.scantlebury, r. a..kdata transmission, error correction, full-duplex,half-duplex, transmission control, communications.c.ca jb february ,   : pm
