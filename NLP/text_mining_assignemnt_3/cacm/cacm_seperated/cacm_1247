an operating environment for dynamic-recursivecomputer programming systems.wpresented in this paper is a brief nontechnicalintroduction to oedipus, a computer programming system which can serve as an operating environment fordynamic and/or recursive programs and programming systems.  the available services include dynamic allocationof storage for contiguous blocks of arbitrary size, input and output for a hierarchy of data types,a public pushdown list for automatic recursive programming, a rudimentary compiler for subroutinecommunication and bookkeeping, and debugging aids.cacm june, brown, w. s.ca jb march ,   : pm
