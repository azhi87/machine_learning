three-dimensional computer display.wa stereographic display terminal has beenproduced using the raster display (brad) recently developed at brookhaven.  the system uses a rotating refreshmemory to feed standard television monitors.  to produce a stereographic display the computer calculatesthe projected video images of an object, viewed from two separate points.  the resulting videomaps are stored on separate refresh bands of the rotating memory.  the two output signals are connectedto separate color guns of a color television monitor, thus creating a superimposed image on the screen.  opticalseparation is achieved by viewing the image through color filters.  the display is interactive andcan be viewed by a large group of people at the same time.cacm june, ophir, d.shepherd, b. j.spinrad, r. j..kcomputer graphics, three-dimensional display, sweptraster display, interactive stereographic terminal, video map, color separation.c. . .ca jb february ,   : pm
