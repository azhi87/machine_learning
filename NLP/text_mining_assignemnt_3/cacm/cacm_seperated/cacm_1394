computation of algebraic properties of elementaryparticle reactions using a digital computer.wa large number of calculations in high-energyelementary particle physics involve the manipulation of complicated algebraic expressions containing bothtensor and noncommutative matrix quantities.  many of these calculations take several months to complete, althoughthe operations involved follow straightforward rules.  in this paper a program is described, which hasbeen developed in lisp for solving such problems.  the manner in which these problems are encountered isoutlined, and their representation in the computer discussed.  at present, about six months of human worktakes less than fifteen minutes on an ibm .  limitations of the present system and future plans are also outlined.cacm august, hearn, a. c.ca jb march ,   : pm
