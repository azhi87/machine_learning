a deductive question-answer for natural language inference.wthe question-answering aspects of the protosynthex iii prototype language processing system are described and exemplified indetail.  the system is written in lisp . and operates on the q-time-sharing system.  the system's data structures and their semanticorganization, the deductive question-answering formalism ofrelational properties and complex-relation-forming operators, andthe question-answering procedures which employ these features intheir operation are all described and illustrated.  examples of thesystem's performance and of the limitations of its question-answering capability are presented and discussed.  it is shown that theuse of semantic information in deductive question answering greatly facilitates the process, and that a top-down procedure which worksfrom question to answer enables effective use to be made of thisinformation.  it is concluded that the development of protosynthexiii into a practically useful system to work with large databases is possible but will require changes in both the datastructures and the algorithms used for question answering.cacm march, schwarcz, r. m.burger, j. f.simmons, r. f..kquestion answering, natural language, protosynthex iii, lisp,semantics, artificial intelligence, computationallinguistics, language processing, fact retrieval.c. .ca jb february ,   : pm
