pseudochaining in hash tables.wthis paper presents pseudochaining as a newcollision-resolution method.  pseudochaining is half way between open addressing and chaining.  it owesits name to the fact that link fields are present in each cell of the hash table which permits "chaining"of the first overflow items in the table.  the efficiency of the method is derived and a tradeoff analysis is given.cacm july, halatsis, c.philokyprou, g..khash code, scatter storage, open addressing, chaining,pseudochaining, collision resolution, searching, uniform probing..c. . . .ca dh february ,   : pm
