proving termination with multiset orderings.wa common tool for proving the termination of programs is the well-foundedset, a set ordered in such a way as to admit no infinite descending sequences.the basic approach is to find a termination function  that mapsthe values of the program variables into some well-founded set,such that the value of the termination function is repeatedly reducedthroughout the computation.  all too often, the termination functions required are difficult to find and are of a complexity outof proportion to the program under consideration. multisets (bags)over a given well-founded set s are sets that admit multiple occurrencesof elements taken from s.  the given ordering on s inducesan ordering on the finite multisets over s.  this multiset orderingis shown to be well-founded.  the multiset ordering enables theuse of relatively simple and intuitive termination functions in otherwisedifficult termination proofs.  in particular, the multisetordering is used to prove the termination of production systems,programs defined in terms of sets of rewriting rules. cacm august, dershowitz, n.manna, z..kprogram correctness, program termination, program verification, well-foundedorderings, well-founded sets, multisets, bags, production systems,term rewriting systems, tree replacement systems, reduction rules.c. .ca db january ,   : pm
