extremely portable random number generator.wextremely portable subroutines are sometimesneeded for which moderate quality and efficiency suffice.  typically, this occurs for library functions(like random number generation and in core sorting) which are not entirely universal or are not used in astandardized way.  the literature on random number generators does not seem to contain an algorithm thatmeets requirements of this sort.  an extremely portable -line fortran program is provided which basedon an important paper by coveyou and macpherson ().using their methods, fourier analysis is appliedto the probability function for the consecutive n-tuples provided by our generator (with n less thanor equal to ).  while the small modulus which must be used to maintain portability prevents the qualityof the generator from being high, the generator compares well with the bounds established in the above mentioned paper.cacm february, kruskal, j. b..krandom number generators, random numbers, randomnumber analysis, random generators, linear sequential generators, random number program, pseudo random numbers .c. . .ca jb february ,   : am
