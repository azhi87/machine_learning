impact of computers on the undergraduate mathematics curriculum .wthe use of computers to permit the widespread applicationof mathematical ideas requiring computation in science and technology is extremely significant forthe understanding of our current society.  student interest in this development is intense and if properlyutilized should yield a much better understanding of mathematical concepts as well as the ideas of programmingand logical structure which have been introduced into many fields by the use of computers.  the presentpaper suggests that that portion of the undergraduate mathematical curriculum which is preparation for the useof mathematics by persons who are not professional mathematicians be modified to include the extensionsand clarifications which are possible because of computers.  an early introduction to programming isdesirable to permit a continuing use of automatic computation to illustrate and clarify mathematical concepts. following the calculus equation stage an intensive introduction to numerical analysis shouldbe added to the current curriculum.  in addition to providing competence in the mostly used computingtechniques, it would permit a more sophisticated utilization of the advanced mathematical ideas associatedwith complex variables and transform theories.cacm september, murray, f. j.ca jb march ,   : pm
