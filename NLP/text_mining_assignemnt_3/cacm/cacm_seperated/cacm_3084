interpolation search -a log logn search.winterpolation search is a method of retrievinga desired record by key in an ordered file by using the value of the key and the statistical distributionof the keys.  it is shown that on the average log logn file accesses are required to retrieve a key,assuming that the n keys are uniformly distributed.  the number of extra accesses is also estimated and shownto be very low.  the same holds if the cumulative distribution function of the keys is known.  computationalexperiments confirm these results.  cacm july, perl, y.itai, a.avni, h..kaverage number of accesses, binary search, database,interpolation search, retrieval, searching, uniform distribution .c. . .ca dh february ,   : pm
