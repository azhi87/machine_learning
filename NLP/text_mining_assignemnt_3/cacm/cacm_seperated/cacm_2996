transient-free working-set statistics.wtransient-free average working set size and transient-freemissing-page rate for a finite sample of a reference string are defined.  use of these statisticsis appropriate if the contents of the working set at the start of the recorded string are unknown. if a certain stationarity condition holds, these statistics provide unbiased estimates of expected working-setsizes, missing-page probabilities, and in terreference distance probabilities.  two other pairsof estimators are shown to be biased.  expressions for the transient-free statistics are obtained in termsof in terval statistics. several methods of computation are discussed, the usefulness of each depending on lengthof the sample, number of distinct references, and the amount of main storage available to the computerperforming the calculations.  in particular, methods are described for handling long stringscontaining many distinct page names.cacm february, easton, m. c.bennett, b. t..kworking set, estimation program behavior.c. . .ca jb december ,   : am
