a policy-driven scheduler for a time-sharing system.wthe service received by a process from a time-sharingoperating system can be characterized by a resource count sum{w[i]r[ij]} where r[ij] is thenumber of units of service received by process i from resource i and w[i] is the cost per unit of theservice.  each class of users can be characterized by a policy function which specifies the amount of servicea user who belongs to this class should receive as a function of time.  priority changes dynamicallyas a function of the difference between the service promised to the user by the policy function and the servicehe actually receives.  a scheduling and swapping algorithm which keeps the resource count of each processabove its policy function will provide the specified level of service.  overhead can be reduced by avoidingswaps of process which have received at least his level of service.  the algorithm has been implementedin a general purpose operating system, and it has provided significantly better service to interactiveand to batch jobs than the previous scheduler.cacm february, bernstein, a. j.sharp, j. c..kscheduler, time-sharing, operating system,resource allocation and swapping.c.ca jb february ,   : am
