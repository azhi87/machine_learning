generating pseudorandom numbers on a two'scomplement machine such as the ibm .wthe familiar multiplicative congruential generatoris examined in the context of the type of two's complement arithmetic used in the ibm  series. different sequences of residues are considered and relationships established among them.  it is shownthat a sequence of positive and negative residues may be produced more simply and economically than withthe conventional approach and yet have twice the period of the latter without loss of desirable statisticalproperties.  another easily generated sequence involving absolute values is also shown to have twicethe period but with less attractive statistical properties.  the statistical properties of these sequencesare given and related to previously established criteria.cacm july, hemmerle, w. j..krandom number, uniform distribution, pseudo-randomnumber, random number generator, multiplicative congruential generator, power residue, two'scomplement arithmetic, ibm  arithmetic.c. . .ca jb february ,   : am
