partitioning algorithms for finite sets.wthe partitions of a set with n elements are representedby certain n-tuples of positive integers.  algorithm are described which generate without repetitionsthe n-tuples corresponding to: () all partitions of the given set, () all partitions of the given setinto m or fewer sets ( <= m <= n), and () all partitions of the given set into exactly m sets ( <= m <= n).cacm october, hutchinson, g.ca jb march ,   : pm
