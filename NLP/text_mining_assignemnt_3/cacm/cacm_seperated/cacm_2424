dynamic verification of operating system decisions.wdynamic verification of a decision impliesthat every time the decision is made there is a consistency check performed on the decision using independenthardware and software.  the dynamic verification of operating system decisions is used on the prime systembeing designed and constructed at the university of california, berkeley.  prime is an experimental time-sharingwhich is to have the properties of continuous availability, data privacy, and cost effectiveness. the technique of dynamic verification allows the construction of an operating system which does not make certaindecisions improperly even in the presence of a single hardware or software fault.  furthermore,multiple faults lead to unreliable operation only if the faults happen to reinforce each other.  on prime,dynamic verification is used to ensure that one user's information cannot become available to anotheruser gratuitously even in the presence of a single hardware or software fault.the amount of additionalhardware and software required for dynamic verification can be modest.cacm november, fabry, r. s..koperating systems, data security, fault tolerance,software reliability, data privacy, program verification, modular computer systems.c.ca jb january ,   : am
