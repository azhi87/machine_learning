generation of rosary permutations expressed in hamiltonian circuits.wsystematic generation of a specific classof permutations fundamental to scheduling problems is described.  in a nonoriented complete graph withn vertices, hamitonian circuits equivalent to .(n - )! specific permutations of n elements, termed rosarypermutations, can be defined.  each of them corresponds to two circular permutations which mirror-imageeach other, and is generated successively by a number system covering **...*(n-) sets of edges. every set of edges {e[k]},  <= e[k] <= k,  <= k <= (n-) is determined recursively by constructinga hamiltonian circuit with k vertices from a hamiltonian circuit with k- vertices, starting withthe hamiltonian circuit of  vertices.  the basic operation consists of transposition of a pair of adjacentvertices where the position of the pair in the permutation is determined by {e[k]}.  two algorithmstreating the same example for five vertices are presented.  it is very easy to derive all possible n!permutations  from the .(n -  )! rosary permutations be cycling the permutations and by taking them in thereverse order-procedures which can be performed fairly efficiently by computer. cacm june, harada, k..kpermutation, graph theory, scheduling, combinatorial algebra.c. .ca jb february ,   : pm
