distributed processes: a concurrent programming concept.wa language concept for concurrent processeswithout common variables is introduced.  these processes communicate and synchronize by means of procedurecalls and guarded regions.  this concept is proposed for real-time applications controlled bymicrocomputer networks with distributed storage.  the paper gives several examples of distributed processesand shows that they include procedures, coroutines, classes, monitors, processes, semaphores, buffers, pathexpressions, and input/output as special cases.cacm november, hansen, p..kconcurrent programming, distributed processes,microprocessor networks, nondeterminism, guarded regions, programming languages, process communicationand scheduling, sorting arrays, coroutines, classes, monitors, processes, semaphores, buffers, path expressions, input/output .c. . . . .ca dh january ,   : am
