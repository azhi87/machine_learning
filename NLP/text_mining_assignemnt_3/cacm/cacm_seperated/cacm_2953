notes on recursion elimination.wvarious methods of recursion elimination areapplied to the schematic recursive procedure: proc s(x); px then n(x); s(fx); s(gx); m(x) fi.  procedureswith this general form arise in connection with tree traversal and sorting algorithms.  each methodof recursion removal involves the use of one or more stacks, and the solutions are comparedon the basis of their running time.cacm june, bird, r. s..krecursion elimination, optimization of programs,stacks, trees, sorting algorithms, computational induction.c. . . . . .ca jb december ,   : pm
