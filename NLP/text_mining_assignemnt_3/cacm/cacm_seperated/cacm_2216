on the probability distribution of the values of binary trees.wan integral equation is derived for the generatingfunction for binary tree values, the values reflecting sorting effort. the analysis does not assumeuniformly distributed branching ratios, and therefore is applicable to a family of sorting algorithmsdiscussed by hoare, singleton, and van emden.  the solution to the integral equation indicates thatusing more advanced algorithms in the family makes only minor reductions in the expected sorting effort,but substantially reduces the variance in sorting effort.  statistical tests of the values of severalthousand trees containing up to , points have given first, second, and third moments of the value distributionfunction in satisfactory agreement with the moments computed from the generating function.  theempirical tests, as well as the analytical results, are in agreement with previously published results for thefirst moment in the cases of uniform and nonuniform distribution of branching ratio, and for the second momentin the case of uniform distribution of branching ratio.cacm february, hurwitz jr., h..kbinary trees, sorting, statistical analysis.c. . .ca jb february ,   : am
