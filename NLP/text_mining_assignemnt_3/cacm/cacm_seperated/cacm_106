a method for overlapping and erasure of lists.wan important property of the newell-shaw-simonscheme for computer storage of lists is that data having multiple occurrences need not be storedat more than one place in the computer.  that is, lists may be "overlapped."  unfortunately, overlappingposes a problem for subsequent erasure.  given a list that is no longer needed, it is desired to erasejust those parts that do not overlap other lists.  in lisp, mccarthy employs an elegant but inefficient solutionto the problem.  the present paper describes a general method which enables efficient erasure.  themethod employs interspersed reference counts to describe the extent of the overlapping.cacm december, collins, g. e.ca jb march ,   : pm
