on lions' counter example for gotlieb's methodfor the construction of school timetables.wthe timetable problem is an essentially discreteproblem. although the discrete problem may have no feasible solution, there may exist a solutionto the equivalent continuous problem.  an example is given, for which the nondiscrete solution can beinterpreted as a set of timetables, differing from week to week, which together satisfy the long-termrequirements of the timetable problem.cacm april, smith, g.sefton, i. m..kcombinatorial, multi-index problem, necessaryconditions, schedule, school timetable, timetable.c. .ca jb january ,   : am
