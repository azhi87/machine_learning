pose: a language for posing problems to a computer.wa language, pose, is described which is a drasticdeparture from the fortran/algol type, though it does utilize fortran formula and logic representations(and actually contains fortran vi as a subset).  with the new language, the user need only describehis problem in "equation-like" form. the method of solution is automatically provided in conjunctionwith the translation from equation form to computer instruction. in this way the pose language user cansolve difficult computational problems (like the solution of differential equation) without requiringa knowledge of numerical methods or the intricacies of computer subroutine logic. essentially all clericaloperations now required for fortran programming have been automated so that the pose programmerneed not be concerned with these details.cacm may, schlesinger, s.sashkin, l.ca jb february ,   : am
