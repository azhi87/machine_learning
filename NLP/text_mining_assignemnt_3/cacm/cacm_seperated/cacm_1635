parameters for pseudo runge-kutta methods.wthe object of this note is to present a choiceof the free parameters in the third- and fourth-order pseudo runge-kutta methods involving two points. thischoice of parameters causes a bound on the principal part of the truncation error term to be near the minimumfor the fourth-order method and at the minimum for the third-order method.cacm february, byrne, g. d.ca jb february ,   : pm
