a variation of the goodman-lance method forthe solution of two-point boundary value problems.wa recently published method for the interpolativesolution of nonlinear equations is improved,and applied to give a significant variation of the goodman-lancemethod for the solution of two-point boundary value problems. the resulting method applies in particular to the numerical solutionof optimal control problems in the euler-lagrange formulation.quantitative estimates are presented which indicate that the variationis nearly twice as fast on some problems in the latter context.cacm september, kimble, g. w..kgoodman-lance, boundary-value problems,newton's method, nonlinear equations,optimal control, optimization, ordinary differential equations,secant method, interpolative solution, orthogonal matrices.c. . .ca jb february ,   : pm
