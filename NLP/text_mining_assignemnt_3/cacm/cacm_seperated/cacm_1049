numerical solution of nonlinear two-pointboundary problems by finite difference methods.wsolution of nonlinear two-point boundary-valueproblems is often an extremely difficult task.  quite apart from questions of reality and uniqueness,there is no established numerical technique for this problem.  at present, shooting techniques are theeasiest method of attacking these problems.  when these fail, the more difficult method of finite differencescan often be used to obtain a solution.  this paper gives examples and discusses the finite differencemethod for non-linear two-point boundary-value problems.cacm june, holt, j. f.ca jb march ,   : pm
