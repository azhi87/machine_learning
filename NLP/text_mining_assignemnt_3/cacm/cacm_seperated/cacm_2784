expected time bounds for selection.wa new selection algorithm is presented whichis shown to be very efficient on the average, both theoretically and practically.  the number of comparisonsused to select the ith smallest of n numbers is n+min(i,n-i)+o(n).  a lower bound within percent of the above formula is also derived.cacm march, floyd, r. w.rivest, r. l..kselection, computational complexity, medians, tournaments, quantiles.c. .ca jb january ,   : pm
