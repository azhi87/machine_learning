ambiguity in limited entry decision tables.wthe use of decision tables as a tool in systemsanalysis and for program specification is now becoming accepted.  rules on redundancy, contradiction,and completeness for limited entry tables were published in .  these are usually used for checking,preceded if necessary by a conversion from extended to limited entry form.  processors which automaticallytranslate tables to more conventional program usually base their diagnostic facilities on these rules. in this paper it is suggested that these rules are unsatisfactory and that the important aspect ofchecking is to eliminate ambiguity from tables.  ambiguity is defined and discussed, and a procedure forproducing checked-out decision tables is proposed.  the theoretical basis of the algorithm used is established.the importance of well-designed diagnostic facilities in decision table processors is emphasized.cacm october, king, p. j. h..kdecision tables, detab-, systems analysis .c. . .ca jb february ,   : pm
