a computer system for transformational grammar.wa comprehensive system for transformationalgrammar has been designed and implemented on the ibm / computer.  the system deals with the transformationalmodel of syntax, along the lines of chomsky's aspects of the theory of syntax. the majorinnovations include a full,formal description of the syntax of a transformational grammar, a directed randomphrase structure generator, a lexical insertion algorithm, an extended definition of analysis, anda simple problem-oriented programming language in which the algorithm for application of transformationscan be expressed.  in this paper we present the system as a whole, first discussing the general attitudes underlyingthe development of the system, then outlining the system and discussing its more importantspecial features.  references are given to papers which consider some particular aspect of the system in detail.cacm june, friedman, j..ktransformational grammar, natural language syntax,language processing, language analysis, sentence generation, lexical insertion, computational linguistics, syntax.c.ca jb february ,   : am
