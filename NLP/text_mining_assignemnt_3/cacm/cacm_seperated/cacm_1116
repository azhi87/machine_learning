tests on a computer method for constructing school timetables*.wa previously proposed computer method for constructingtimetables, based on an iteration involving boolean matrices, is described.  in limited tests themethod has successfully produced timetables on every trial.  references are given which relate thetimetable problem to theorems on matrices of zeros and ones, and to theorems on bipartite graphs.  someproblems of applying the method to constructing timetables in real situations are noted.cacm march, csima, j.gotlieb, c. c.ca jb march ,   : am
