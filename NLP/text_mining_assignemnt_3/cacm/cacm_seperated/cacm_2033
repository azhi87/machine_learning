space/time trade-offs in hash coding with allowable errors.win this paper trade-offs among certain computational factorsa given set of messages.  two new hash-coding methods are examinedand compared with a particular conventional hash-coding method.the computational factors considered are the size of the hash area(space), the time required to identify a message as a nonmember of the given set (reject time), and an allowable error frequency.  the new methods are intended to reduce the amount of space required to contain the hash-coded information from that associated with conventional methods.  the reduction in space is accomplished by exploiting the possibility that a small fraction of errors of commission may be tolerable in some applications, in particular, applications in which a large amount of data is involved and a core residenthash area is consequently not feasible using conventional methods.  in such applications, it is envisaged that overall performancecould be improved by using a smaller core resident hash area inconjunction with the new methods and, when necessary, by using somesecondary and perhaps time-consuming test to "catch" the smallfraction of errors associated with new methods.  an example is discussedwhich illustrates possible areas of application for the newmethods.  analysis of the paradigm problem demonstrates that allowinga small number of test messages to be falsely identified asmembers of the given set will permit a much smaller hasharea to be used without increasing reject time.cacm july, bloom, b. h..khash coding, hash addressing, scatter storage, searching, storagelayout, retrieval trade-offs, retrieval efficiency, storage efficiency.c. . .ca jb february ,   : am
