guarded commands, nondeterminacy and formal derivation of programs.wso-called "guarded commands" are introducedas a building block for alternative and repetitive constructs that allow nondeterministic program componentsfor which at least the activity evoked, but possible even the final state, is not necessarily uniquelydetermined by the initial state.  for the formal derivation of programs expressed in termsof these constructs, a calculus will be shown.cacm august, dijkstra, e. w..kprogramming languages, sequencing primitives, programsemantics, programming language semantics, nondeterminacy, case-construction, repetition, termination,correctness proof, derivation of programs, programming methodology.c. .ca jb january ,   : pm
