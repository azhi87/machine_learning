a design for a number theory packagewith an optimized trial division routine.wa number theory package is described which usesdoubly linked list structures for storing multiprecise integers.  the package has been coded in ibm's basicassembly language and makes heavy use of the macro language and conditional assembly.  an optimally codedtrial division routine is also described which can be used to determine the unique factorization of large integers.cacm may, wunderlich, m. c.selfridge, j. l..knumber theory package, trial division, multiprecisearithmetic, factorization, doubly linked lists, pseudoprime.c.ca jb january ,   : pm
