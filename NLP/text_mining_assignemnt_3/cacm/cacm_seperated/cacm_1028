investigation of a new analytical methodfor numerical derivative evaluation.wa recently proposed analytical approach tonumerical derivative evaluation is discussed.  the technique is shown to be both accurate and easy toapply, though certain indicated modifications are required.  its use should greatly facilitate the writingand debugging of programs requiring derivatives of highly complex functions.cacm august, wilkins, r. d.ca jb march ,   : pm
