mirfag: a compiler based on standardmathematical notation and plain english.wa pilot version of the compiler mirfag, nowin operation, is described.  the chief features of the system, which is intended for the solution of scientificproblems, are the presentation of mathematical formulas entirely in standard textbook notation.  the useof plain english for organizational instructions, automatic error diagnosis indicating the actual locationof the error in the uncompiled program, and an attempt to minimize that fragmentation of the originalproblem statement which is a normal feature of programming systems.cacm september, gawlik, h. j.ca jb march ,   : pm
