a comparison of list-processing computer languages(including a detailed comparison of comit, ipl-v, lisp ., and slip).wa detailed comparison is presented of comit,ipl-v, lisp . and slip - four well-known computer programming languages which, among them, exhibit all theprincipal characteristics of existing list-processing languages.  important common features of list-processinglanguages are reviewed: forms of data structures which are manipulated, necessity for dynamic allocationof storage, use of pushdown stores, and use of recursive operations.  principal differences between thefour languages under consideration are detailed: representations of data, both by the programmer and withinthe machine; methods for storage allocation; programming formalisms and special processes available,including arithmetic facilities; and usability in terms of availability, documentation, learning aidsand debugging facilities.  a rough comparison shows that all the languages discussed have approximatelythe same speed.  finally, the authors give some heuristics to aid in the selection of one of theselanguages for use in particular problem applications, concluding that no one of the languages considered isdistinctly superior in all possible list-processing applications.cacm april, bobrow, d. g.raphael, b.ca jb march ,   : am
