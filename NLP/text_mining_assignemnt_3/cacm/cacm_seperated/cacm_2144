on accurate floating-point summation.wthe accumulation of floating-point sums isconsidered on a computer which performs t-digit base b floating-point addition with exponents in the range-m to m.  an algorithm is given for accurately summing n t-digit floating-point numbers.  each ofthese n numbers is split into q parts, forming qn t-digit floating-point numbers.  each of these is thenadded to the appropriate one of n auxiliary t-digit accumulators.  finally, the accumulators are added togetherto yield the computed sum.  in all, qn+n- t-digit floating-point additions are performed.  underusual conditions, the relative error in the computed sum is at most [(t+)/v]b^(-t) for some v.  further,with an additional q+n- t-digit additions, the computed sum can be corrected to full t-digit accuracy. for example, for the ibm/ (b=, t=, m=, m=), typical values for q and n are q= and n=. in this case, (*) becomes n <= ,, and we have [(t+)/v]b^(-t) = x^-.cacm november, malcolm, m. a..kfloating-point summation, error analysis.c. .ca jb february ,   : am
