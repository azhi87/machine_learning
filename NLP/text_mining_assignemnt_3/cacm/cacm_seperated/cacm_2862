analysis of the pff replacement algorithm via a semi-markov model.wan analytical model is presented to estimatethe performance of the page fault frequency (pff) replacement algorithm.  in this model, program behavioris represented by the lru stack distance model and the pff replacement algorithm is represented by a semi-markovmodel.  using these models, such parameters as the inter-page-fault interval distribution, theprobability of the number of distinct pages being referenced during an inter-page-fault interval, etc. areable to be analytically determined.  using these models to evaluate these parameter values permits studyof the performance of the replacement algorithm by simulating the page fault events rather than everypage reference event.  this significantly reduces the required computation time in estimatingthe performance of the pff algorithm.cacm may, chu, w. w.opderbeck, h..kpff replacement algorithm, semi-markovmodel, simulation of replacement algorithm.c. .ca jb january ,   : pm
