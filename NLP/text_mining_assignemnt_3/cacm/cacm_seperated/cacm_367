topological ordering of a list ofrandomly-numbered elements of a network.wa network of directed line segments free of circularelements is assumed.  the lines are identified by their terminal nodes and the nodes are assumed tobe numbered by a non-topological system.  given a list of these lines in numeric order, a simple techniquecan be used to create at high speed a list in topological order.cacm april, lasser, d. j.ca jb march ,   : am
