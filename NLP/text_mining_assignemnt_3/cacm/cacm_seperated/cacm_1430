multiple precision floating-point conversionfrom decimal-to-binary and vice versa.wdecimal-to-binary and binary-to-decimal floating-pointconversion is often performed by using a table of the powers ^i, (ia positive integer) forconverting from base  to base , and by using a table of the coefficient of a polynomial approximationof ^x, (<=x<) for converting from base  to base .  these tables occupy a large storage regionin the case of a nonsingle precision conversion.  this paper shows that a single small table sufficesfor a floating-point conversion from decimal to binary, and vice versa, in any useful precision.cacm may, mancino, o. g.ca jb march ,   : am
