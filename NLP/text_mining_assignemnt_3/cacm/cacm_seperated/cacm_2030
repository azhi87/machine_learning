context-sensitive parsing.wthis paper presents a canonical form for context-sensitivederivations and a parsing algorithm which findseach context-sensitive analysis once and only once.  the amount of memoryrequired by the algorithm is essentially no more than the required to store a single complete derivation.  in addition, a modifiedversion of the basic algorithm is presented which blocks infinite analyses for grammars which contain loops.  the algorithm isalso compared with several previous parsers for context-sensitivegrammars and general rewriting systems, and the difference betweenthe two types of analyses is discussed.  the algorithm appears tobe complementary to an algorithm by s. kuno in several respects, including the space-time trade-off and the degree of context dependence involved.cacm july, woods, w. a..kcontext-sensitive grammars, context-sensitive parsing, formal grammars,formal language theory, parsing, parsing algorithms, recognition algorithms.c. . .ca jb february ,   : pm
