length of strings for a merge sort.wdetailed statistics are given on the lengthof maximal sorted strings which result form the first (internal sort) phase of a merge sort onto tapes. it is shown that the strings produced by an alternating method (i.e. one which produces ascendingand descending strings alternately) tend to be only three-fourths as long as those in a method which producesonly ascending strings, contrary to statements which have appeared previously in the literature.  aslight modification of the read-backward polyphase merge algorithm is therefore suggested.cacm november, knuth, d. e.ca jb march ,   : pm
