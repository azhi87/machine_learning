the notions of consistency and predicate locks in a database system.win database systems, users access shared dataunder the assumption that the data satisfies certain consistency constraints.  this paper defines theconcepts of transaction, consistency and schedule and shows that consistency requires that a transactioncannot request new locks after releasing a lock.  then it is argued that a transaction needs to lock a logicalrather than a physical subset of the database.  these subsets may be specified by predicates.  animplementation of predicate locks which satisfies the consistency condition is suggested.cacm november, eswarran, k..gray, j..lorie, r..traiger, i. l..kconsistency, lock, database, concurrency, transaction.c. .ca jb january ,   : pm
