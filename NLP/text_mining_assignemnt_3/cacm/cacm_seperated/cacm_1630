computer representation of planar regions by their skeletons.wany region can be regarded as a union of maximalneighborhoods of its points, and can be specified by the centers and radii of these neighborhoods; thisset is a sort of"skeleton" of the region.  the storage required to represent a region in this way iscomparable to that required when it is represented by encoding its boundary.  moreover, the skeleton representationseems to have advantages when it is necessary to determine repeatedly whether points are insideor outside the region, or to perform set-theoretic operations on regions.cacm february, pfaltz, j. l. rosenfeld, a.ca jb february ,   : pm
