the augmented predictive analyzer for context-freelanguages-its relative efficiency.wit has been proven by greibach that for a givencontext-free grammar g, a standard-form grammar gs can be constructed, which generates the same languagesas is generated by g and whose rules are all of the form z --> cy() ... y(m), (m >= o) where z andy(i) are intermediate symbols and c a terminal symbol.  since the predictive analyzer at harvard usesa standard-form grammar, it can accept the language of any context-free grammar g, given an equivalent standard-formgrammar gs.  the structural descriptions sd(gs,x) assigned to a given sentence x by the predictiveanalyzer, however, are usually different from the structural descriptions sd(g,x) assigned to thesame sentence by the original context-free grammar g from which gs is derived.  in section , an algorithm,originally due to abbott is described standard-form grammar each of whose rules is in standard form, supplementedby additional information describing its derivation from the original context-free grammar. a technique for performing the sd(gs,x) to sd(g,x) transformation effectively is also described.  in section, the augmented predictive analyzer as a parsing algorithm for arbitrary context-free languages is comparedwith two other parsing algorithms: a selective top-to-bottom algorithm similar to irons' "error correctingparse algorithm" and an immediate constituent analyzer which is an extension of sakai-cocke's algorithmfor normal grammars.  the comparison is based upon several criteria of efficiency, covering core-storagerequirements, complexities of the programs and processing time.cacm november, kuno,s.ca jb march ,   : pm
