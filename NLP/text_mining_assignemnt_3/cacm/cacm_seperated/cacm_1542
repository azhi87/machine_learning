a microprogrammed implementation of euler on ibm system/ model .wan experimental processing system for the algorithmiclanguage euler has been implemented in microprogramming on an ibm system/ model  using asecond read-only storage unit.  the system consists of a microprogrammed compiler and a microprogrammedstring language interpreter, and of an i/o control program written in  machine language.  the system is describedand results are given in terms of microprogram and main storage space required and compiler and interpreterperformance obtained.  the role of microprogramming is stressed, which opens a new dimension in the processingof interpretive code.  the structure and content of a higher level language can be matched by an appropriateinterpretive language which can be executed efficiently by microprograms on existing computer hardware.cacm september, weber, h.ca jb february ,   : pm
