decomposability, instabilities, andsaturation in multiprogramming systems.wa step-by-step approach to model the dynamicbehavior and evaluate the performance of computing systems is proposed.  it is based on a technique of variableaggregation and the concept of nearly decomposable system, both borrowed from econometrics.  this approachis taken in order to identify in multiprogramming paging systems (i) unstable regimes of operations and (ii)critical computing loads which bring the system into states of saturation.  this analysis leads to amore complete definition of the circumstances in which "thrashing" can set in.cacm july, courtois, p. j..kmultiprogramming, paging, performance evaluation,saturation, instabilities, thrashing, aggregation, system levels, hierarchy,networks of queues.c. . . .ca jb january ,   : am
