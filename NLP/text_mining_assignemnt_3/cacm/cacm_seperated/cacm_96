on computing radiation integrals.wthe relative merit and cost of four ways ofevaluating typical radiation integrals containing spherical bessel functions are investigated.  these methodsare desk machine evaluation of a finite series, integration of the appropriate differential equationby a reeves electronic analog computer and by a litton  ibm  computer.  results are generally applicableto equations separated from a helmholtz or wave equation.cacm february, hansen, r. c.bailin, l. l.rutishauser, r. w.ca jb march ,   : pm
