a method of bivariate interpolation and smoothsurface fitting based on local procedures.wa method is designed for interpolating valuesgiven at points of a rectangular grid in a plane by a smooth bivariate function z=z(x,y).  the interpolatingfunction is a bicubic polynomial in each cell of the rectangular grid.  emphasis is an avoidingexcessive undulation between given grid points. the proposed method is an extension of the method ofunivariate interpolation developed earlier by the author and is likewise based on local procedures.cacm january, akima, h..kbivariate interpolation, interpolation, partialderivative, polynomial, smooth surface fitting.c.ca jb january ,   : pm
