read-backward polyphase sorting.wread-backward polyphase sorting provides moreefficient use of the tapes available to a sort than most other sorting techniques.  backward polyphaseproduces a continuous merging process from n- tapes where n is the total number of tapes being used inthe sorting process.  any of the available presorting techniques may be used in conjunction with the polyphasemerge sort provided that the presort has the capability of producing both ascending and descendingstrings and distributing the strings on the various tapes as required by the polyphase merge.cacm may, gilstad, r. l.ca jb march ,   : am
