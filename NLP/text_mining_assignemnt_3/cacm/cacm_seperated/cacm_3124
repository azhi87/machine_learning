recursive data structures in apl.wa mathematical study of three approaches for defining nestedarrays in apl is presented.  theorems exhibiting the relationshipsbetween the definitional systems are given and illustrated through graphrepresentations.  one of the approaches is used to define anapl array to be a recursive data structure equivalent to a tree structurein which all data is stored at the leaves as homogeneousarrays of numbers and characters.  an extension of apl is proposed thatincludes new primitive functions to manipulate the nestinglevel of arrays and new operators to assist in theconstruction of data-driven algorithms.  cacm february, gull,w.e.jenkins, m.a..knested arrays, apl arrays, recursive data structures,trees, data-driven algorithms, theory of arrays.c. .ca dh april ,   : pm
