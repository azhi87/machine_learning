an extension of fibonaccian search to several variables.wa technique which uses fibonaccian searchconcepts has been developed to solve optimization problems involving unimodal functions of several variables. the technique has not been proven to be optimal in the sense that the one-dimensional fibonacciansearch is.  however, it is valuable for certain kinds of calculations.cacm october, krolak, p.cooper, l.ca jb march ,   : pm
