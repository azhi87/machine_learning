gauss harmonic interpolation formulas.wlet r be an open, bounded, simply connectedregion in the (x,y)-plane and let (x*,y*) be a point in r.  assuming r is starlike with respect to(x*,y*), we discuss a method for computing gauss harmonic interpolation formulas for r and the point (x*,y*). such formulas approximate a harmonic function at (x*,y*) in terms of a linear combination of itsvalues at certain selected points on the boundary of r.  such formulas are useful for approximatingthe solution of the dirichlet problem for r.cacm august, stroud, a. h..kinterpolation, quadrature, harmonic interpolation,harmonic quadrature, dirichlet problem.c. . .ca jb january ,   : am
