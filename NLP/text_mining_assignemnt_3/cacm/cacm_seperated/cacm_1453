a nonrecursive method of syntax specification.wthe use of the kleene regular expression notationfor describing algebraic language syntax, in particular of algol, is described in this paper. a fortran ii computer program for carrying out the elimination algorithm of gorn,similar to gaussian eliminationfor linear systems of algebraic equations, is described.  this was applied to numerous smallerlanguages, including some sublanguage of algol.  a hand calculation result of the application of the algorithmto all of algol is given, thus expressing the revised algol  syntax in completely nonrecursiveterms, as far as its context-free portion is concerned.  this description in many ways is far moreintuitively understood than the previous recursive description, it is suggested.  the paper also includesresults of the machine program, which does not include a simplification algorithm.cacm april, carr iii, j. w.weiland, j.ca jb march ,   : am
