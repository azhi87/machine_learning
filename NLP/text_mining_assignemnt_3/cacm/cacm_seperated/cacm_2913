the aliasing problem in computer-generated shaded images.wcertain defects, such as jagged edges anddisappearing detail, have long been an annoyance in digitally generated shaded images.  although increasingthe resolution or defocusing the display can attenuate them, an understanding of these defects leadsto more effective methods.  this paper explains the observed defects in terms of the aliasing phenomenoninherent in sampled signals and discusses prefiltering as a recognized cure.  a method for evaluating filtersis presented, the application of prefiltering to hidden-surface algorithms is discussed, and an implementationof a filtering tiler is shown accompanied by examples of its effectiveness.cacm november, crow, f. c..kaliasing, computer graphics, convolutionalfiltering, hidden-surface removal, sampling.c.ca jb december ,   : am
