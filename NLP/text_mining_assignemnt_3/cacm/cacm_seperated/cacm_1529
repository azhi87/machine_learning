decomposition programming an analysis of matrix substructure .wa petroleum blending problem was analyzed in orderto compare the primal and primal-dual decomposition algorithms.  in the course of the analysis, a substructurewas discovered which has relevance to the relative performance of the two algorithms and to theirabsolute performance as compared with a standard primal-simplex solution without decomposition.cacm october, bell, e. j.ca jb february ,   : pm
