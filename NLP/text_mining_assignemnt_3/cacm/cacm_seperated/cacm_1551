on compiling algorithms for arithmetic expressions.wthis paper deals with algorithms concerning arithmeticexpressions used in a fortran iv compiler for a hitac- computer having n accumulators.  thealgorithms generate an object code which minimizes the frequency of storing and recovering the partial resultsof the arithmetic expressions in cases where there are several accumulators.cacm august, nakata, i.ca jb february ,   : pm
