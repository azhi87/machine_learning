storing a sparse table.wthe problem of storing and searching large sparse tables is ubiquitous in computer science.  the standard technique for storing such tables ishashing, but hashing has poor worst-case performance.  we proposea good worst-case method for storing a static table of n entries,each an integer between  and n - .  the method requires (n) wwords of storage and allows o(logn n) access time.  although our methodis a little complicated to use in practice, our analysis showswhy a simpler algorithm used for compressing lr parsing tables works so well.cacm november, tarjan, r.e.yao, a.c.c..kgaussian elimination, parsing, searching,sparse matrix, table compression, table lookup.c. . . .ca db january ,   : am
