a lisp garbage-collector for virtual-memory computer systems.win this paper a garbage-collection algorithmfor list-processing systems which operate within very large virtual memories is described.  the objectof the algorithm is more the compaction of active storage than the discovery of free storage.  because freestorage is never really exhausted, the decision to garbage collect is not easily made; therefore,various criteria of this decision are discussed.cacm november, fenichel, r. r.yochelson, j. c..kgarbage-collector, virtual memory, list-processing, storage-allocation.c. .ca jb february ,   : pm
