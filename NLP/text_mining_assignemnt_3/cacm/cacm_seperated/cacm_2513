a nonrecursive list moving algorithm.wan efficient, nonrecursive algorithm is givenfor moving any lisp-type list.  in particular, the algorithm requires no storage other than the newnodes into which the list is to be moved, and no additional bits per node for marking; the algorithmruns in time proportional to the number of nodes in the list.  the original list structure is destroyed as it is moved.cacm may, reingold, e. m..klist moving, list copying, list traversal, garbage collection lisp.c. .ca jb january ,   : pm
