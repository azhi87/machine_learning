interference between communicating parallel processes.wvarious kinds of interference between communicatingparallel processes have been examined by dijkstra, knuth, and others.  solutions have been givenfor the mutual exclusion problem and associated subproblems, in the form of parallel programs, and informalproofs of correctness have been given for these solutions.  in this paper a system of parallelprocesses is regarded as a machine which proceeds from one state s (i.e. a collection of pertinent datavalues and process configurations) to a next state s' in accordance with a transition rule s --> s'.  aset of such rules yields sequences of states, which dictate the system's behavior.  the mutual exclusion problemand the associated subproblems are formulated as questions of inclusion between sets of states, orof the existence of certain sequences.  a mechanical proof procedure is shown, which will either verify (provethe correctness of ) or discredit (prove the incorrectness of) an attempted solution, with respectto any of the interference properties.  it is shown how to calculate transition rules from the "partialrules" by which the individual processes operate.  the formation of partial rules and the calculation oftransition rules are both applicable to hardware processes as well as to software processes, andsymmetry between processes is not required.cacm june, gilbert, p.chandler, w. j..kconcurrent programming control, cooperating processes,formal programs, interference, mutual exclusion, operating systems, parallel processes.c. . . . . . .ca jb january ,   : am
