spelling correction in systems programs.wseveral specialized techniques are shown for efficientlyincorporating spelling correction algorithms into compilers and operating systems.  these include the use of syntaxand semantics information, the organization of restricted keywordand symbol tables, and the consideration of a limited class of spellingerrors.  sample  coding for performing spelling correctionis presented.  by using systems which perform spelling correction,the number of debugging runs per program has been decreased,saving both programmer and machine time.cacm february, morgan, h. l..kspelling correction, error correction, debugging, compilers,operating systems, diagnostics, error detection, misspelling, lexical analysis systems programming.c. . . .ca jb february ,   : am
