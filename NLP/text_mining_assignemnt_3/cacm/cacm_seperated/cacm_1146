an efficient composite formula for multidimensional quadrature.wa (s+)-point second-degree quadrature formulafor integration over an s-dimensional hyper-rectangle is presented.  all but one of the points lie on thesurface with weights of opposite sign attached to points on opposite faces.  when a large volume is subdividedinto congruent rectangular subdivisions, only one point is required in each interior subdivisionto achieve second-degree accuracy.cacm january, thacher jr., h. c.ca jb march ,   : am
