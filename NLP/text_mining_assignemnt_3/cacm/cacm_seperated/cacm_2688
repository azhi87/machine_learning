attribute based file organization in a paged memory environment.wthe high cost of page accessing implies a needfor more careful data organization in a paged memory than is typical of most inverted file and similarapproaches to multi-key retrieval.  this article analyses that cost and proposes a method called multiplekey hashing which attempts to minimize it.  since this approach is not always preferable to inversion,a combined method is described.  the exact specifications of this combination for a file with givendata and traffic characteristics is formulated as a mathematical program.  the proposed heuristic solutionto this program can often improve on a simple inversion technique by a factor of  or .cacm february,rothnie, j. b. jr.lozano, t..kfile organization, paging, retrieval algorithm,inverted file, multiple key hashing.c. . . .ca jb january ,   : pm
