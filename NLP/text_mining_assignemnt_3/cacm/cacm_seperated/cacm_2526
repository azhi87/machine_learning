asymmetric memory hierarchies.w a study is presented of some of the systemimplications of memory hierarchies in which the backing or secondary store has a very small read time,relative of both the time required for writing and to the read time of conventional backing storagedevices. several analytic models are introduced, and it is shown that such hierarchies may operate inways which differ from those of more conventional hierarchies.  in particular, it is shown that it may notbe necessary to multiprogram in such a situation.  in the past, backing storage devices have been roughlysymmetric with respect to their read and write times.  this situation may not continue, as severaldevices are currently under development which may have a very small read-time/write-time ratio.  this studyplaces particular emphasis on one such system-the rca read/write holographic optical memory.cacm april, williams, j.g..kasymmetric memory hierarchy, demand paging, holographicoptical memory, memory device, memory hierarchy, paging, storage device, storage hierarchy, virtual memory.c. . . . .ca jb january ,   : am
