an improvement to iterative methods of polynomial factorization.wmethods of polynomial factorization whichfind the zeros one at a time require the division of the polynomial by the accepted factor.  it is shownhow the accuracy of this division may be increased by dividing in order of both ascending and descendingpowers of the variable and choosing a crossover point which minimizes a very simply calculated error criterion.cacm january, bingham, j. a. c.ca jb february ,   : pm
