the design of the venus operating system.wthe venus operating system is an experimentalmultiprogramming system which supports five or six concurrent users on a small computer.  the system wasproduced to test the effect of machine architecture on complexity of software.  the system is defined bya combination of microprograms and software.  the microprogram defines a machine with some unusual architecturalfeature; the software exploits these features to define the operating system as simply as possible. in this paper the development of the system is described, with particular emphasis on the principles which guided the design.cacm march, liskov, b. h..koperating systems, system design, levels of abstraction,machine architecture, microprogramming, segments, semaphores, multiprogramming, virtual machines,processes, process communication, virtual devices, data sharing, resource management, deadlock.c. . . .ca jb january ,   : pm
