symbol manipulation in fortran-sasp i subroutines.wa set of subroutines for use in fortran aredescribed whose purpose is to synthesize output strings from (i) input strings which have been analyzedby the shadow general syntactic analysis subroutine reported earlier, and/or (ii) packed bcd strings formedin any way.  function-type subroutines are included for intermediate manipulations, which are performedon the strings which are stored in an abbreviated internal representation.  the automatic way in whichan internal representation for each newly created substring is stored sequentially in a block of commonstorage, and the manner in which a storage block is dynamically allocated for that purpose, are discussed.cacm june, bailey, m. j.barnett, m. p.burleson, p. b.ca jb march ,   : pm
