a comparison of multivariate normal generators.wthree methods for generating outcomes on multivariatenormal random vectors with a specified variance-covariance matrix are presented.  a comparisonis made to determine which method requires the least computer execution time and memory space when utilizingthe ibm /.  all methods use as a basis a standard gaussian random number generator.  resultsof the comparison indicate that the method based on triangular factorization of the covariance matrixgenerally requires less memory space and computer time than the other two methods. cacm december, barr, d. r.sezak, n. l..krandom number generator, normal distribution, multivariatenormal distribution, multivariate normal generator.c. .ca jb january ,   : am
