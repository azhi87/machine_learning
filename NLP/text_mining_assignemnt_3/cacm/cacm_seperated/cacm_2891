an anomaly in disk scheduling: a comparison offcfs and sstf seek scheduling using an empirical model for disk accesses.wa model for disk accesses based on publishedmeasurements is developed.  the model is used to show that under highly probable conditions, fcfsseek scheduling is superior to sstf scheduling in the sense of having a lower mean queue length.  a simpleexample of an arrival sequence illustration this anomaly is presented.cacm january, wilhelm, n. c..kdisks, disk scheduling, seek scheduling.c. . . . .ca jb january ,   : am
