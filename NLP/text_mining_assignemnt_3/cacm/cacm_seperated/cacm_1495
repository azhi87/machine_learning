solution of transcendental equations by series reversion.wan algorithm is developed for expressing thesolution y, of the equation f(y) = g(x) as a power series in (x - x) when f and g are given as power series,andthe root y, is known at y=x.  the algorithm is illustrated for the equation y^y = x, i.e., (+y)*ln(+y) = ln(+x).cacm january, thacher jr., h. c.ca jb march ,   : pm
