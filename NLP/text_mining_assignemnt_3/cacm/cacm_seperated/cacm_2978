analysis of design alternatives for virtual memory indexes.wa class of index structures for use in a virtualmemory environment is described.  design alternatives within this class of index structures are analyzed.  thesealternatives include a choice of search strategy, whether or not pages in the index are structured, andwhether or not keys are compressed.  the average cost of retrieving entries from these indexes is expressedas a wieghted sum of the cost of a basic key comparison and the cost of crossing a page boundary inthe index structure.  formulas for the retrieval costs for possible combinations of design alternativesare given.  these are used in numerical case studies which compare the retrieval costs of the alternatives. qualitative comparisons of the main tenance costs (insertion, deletion, reorganization) of thedesign alternatives are also included.cacm april, maruyama, k.smith, s. e..kindex, index structure, pages, virtual memory,files, retrieval, main tenance, search strategy, key compression.c. . . . .ca jb december ,   : am
