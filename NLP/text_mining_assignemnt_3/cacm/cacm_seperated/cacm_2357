mux, a simple approach to on-line computing.wan on-line system operating as part of a normalbatch system for the cdc  computer is described.  the system, which required one man-year for initialsoftware implementation, although basically simple,provides the necessary elements to input and modify files,submit them for batch execution, and provide results at the user's terminal.  a multiplexer designedand developed as part of the project cost one man-year for design and checkout, and $, for partsand fabrication.  all aspects of the system are described, including design criteria, implementation,cost, overhead, and user reactions.cacm may, christman, r. d..ktime-sharing, remote computing, on-line access,on-line computing, remote file manager, real time, multiplexer, implementation effort, operating overhead,user reactions, remote terminals, operating system.c. . . .ca jb january ,   : am
