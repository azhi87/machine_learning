abstraction mechanisms in clu.wclu is a new programming language designed to supportthe use of abstractions in program construction.  work in programming methodology has led to the realizationthat three kinds of abstractions-procedural, control, and especially data abstractions-are usefulin the programming process.  of these, only the procedural abstraction is supported well by conventionallanguages, through the procedure or subroutine.  clu provides, in addition to procedures, novel linguisticmechanisms that support the use of data and control abstractions.  this paper provides an in troductionto the abstraction mechanisms in clu.  by means of programming examples, the utility of the threekinds of abstractions in program construction is illustrated, and it is shown how clu programs maybe written to use and implement abstractions.  the clu library, which permits incremental program developmentwith complete type checking performed at compile time, is also discussed.cacm august, liskov, b.snyder, a.atkinson, r.schaffert, c..kprogramming languages, data types, data abstractions,control abstractions, programming methodology, separate compilation.c. . . .ca jb december ,   : am
