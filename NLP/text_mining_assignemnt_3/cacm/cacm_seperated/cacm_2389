preliminary report on a system for general space planning.wa computer language and a set of programs withinthat language are described which allow the formulating and solving of a class of space planningproblems.  the language is an extension of algol and includes means to represent spaces and objects, to manipulatethem, and to test the resulting arrangements according to a variety of constraints.  the algorithmsused to solve problems expressed in this language rely on heuristic programming.  both the languageand the search algorithms are detailed.cacm february, eastman, c. m..kautomated design, architecture, heuristic programs, space planning.c. . . .ca jb january ,   : pm
