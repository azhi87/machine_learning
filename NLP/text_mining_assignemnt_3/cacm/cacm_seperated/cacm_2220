conversion of limited-entry decision tables to computerprograms-a proposed modification to pollack's algorithm.wpollack has proposed an algorithm for convertingdecision tables into flowcharts which minimize subsequent execution time when compiled into a computerprogram.  two modifications of this algorithm are proposed.  the first relies on shannon's noiselesscoding theorem and the communications concept of entropy but does not completely test the else rule. the second modification completely tests the else rule but results in more executions than the first modification. both modifications result in modification guarantees a globally optimal solution.cacm february, shwayder, k..kcoding, decision table, entropy, informationtheory, noiseless channel, sorting.c. .ca jb february ,   : am
