natural language question-answering systems: .wrecent experiments in programming naturallanguage question-answering systems are reviewedto summarize the methods that have been developed for syntactic, semantic,and logical analysis of english strings.  it is concludedthat at least minimally effective techniques have been devised foranswering questions from natural language subsets in small scaleexperimental systems and that a useful paradigm has evolved to guideresearch efforts in the field.  current approaches to semanticanalysis and logical inference are seen to be effective beginningsbut of questionable generality with respect either to subtle aspects of meaning or to applications over large subsets of english. generalizing from current small-scale experiments to language-processing systems based on dictionaries with thousands of entries-withcorrespondingly large grammars and semantic systems-may entaila new order of complexity and require the invention and developmentof entirely different approaches to semantic analysis and questions answering.cacm january, simmons, r. f..kquestion-answering, natural language, artificial intelligence,languageprocessing, fact retrieval, semantics .c. . . .ca jb february ,   : pm
