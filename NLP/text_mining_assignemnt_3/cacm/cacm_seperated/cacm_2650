order-n correction for regular languages.wa method is presented for calculating a stringb, belonging to a given regular language l, which is "nearest" (in number of edit operations) to agiven input string a.  b is viewed as a reasonable "correction" for the possibly erroneous string a, wherea was originally intended to be a string of l.  the calculation of b by the method presented requirestime proportional to |a|, the number of characters in a.  the method should find applications in informationretrieval, artificial intelligence, and spelling correction systems.cacm may, wagner, r. a..kerror correction, regular languages, regular events,finite state automata, compiler error recovery, spelling correction, string best match problem, correction,corrector, errors, nondeterministic finite-state automata.c. . . . .ca jb january ,   : pm
