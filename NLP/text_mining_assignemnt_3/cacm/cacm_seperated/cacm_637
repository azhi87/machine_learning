a neliac-generated - compiler.wneliac systems for several different machineshave been generated using the original neliac system developed at the naval electronics laboratory,san diego, in .  a basic "bootstrap" process was used to generate all but the first, i.e. the systemswere described in the neliac language and generated by an existing neliac compiler.  this experience hasshown there is no inherent difficulty in "building compilers with compilers"; indeed, it pointed out many advantagesin using a pol for constructing programming systems.  this report presents the results of a projectcompleted in may,  in which the neliac system was used to generate a compiler for the ibm .  the compiler, which runs on the  and produces  programs, was described in the neliac language andgenerated with  neliac system.  the reduction in programming time and the improvement in documentationof the system were very significant.cacm february, watt, j. b.wattenburg, w. h.ca jb march ,   : pm
