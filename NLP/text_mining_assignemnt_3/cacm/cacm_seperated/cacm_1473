the stability of the fourth order runge-kuttamethod for the solution of systems of differential equations.wthe problem of the region of stability of thefourth order-runge-kutta method for the solution of systems of differential equations is studied.  thisregion can be characterized by means of linear transformation but can not be given in a closed form. in the paper, this region is determined by the electronic digital computer z.cacm february, karim, a. i. a.ca jb march ,   : pm
