a note on storage fragmentation and program segmentation.wthe main purpose of this paper is the presentationof some of the results of a series of simulation experiments investigating the phenomenon of storage fragmentation. two different types of storage fragmentation are distinguished: () external fragmentation, namely theloss in storage utilization caused by the inability to make use of all available storage after it has beenfragmented into a large number of separate blocks; and () internal fragmentation, the loss of utilizationcaused by rounding up a request for storage, rather than allocating only the exact number of words required. the most striking result is the apparently general rule that rounding up requests for storage,to reduce the number of different sizes of blocks coexisting in storage, causes more loss of storageby increased internal fragmentation than is saved by decreased external fragmentation.  described also area method of segment allocation and an accompanying technique for segment addressing which take advantageof the above result.  evidence is presented of possible advantages of the method over conventional paging techniques.cacm july, randell, b..kstorage allocation, storage fragmentation,paging, segmentation, addressing.c. .ca jb february ,   : am
