recovery of reentrant list structures in slip.wone consequence of the reference-count-basedspace-recovery system employed by slip is that reentrant list structures are not recovered even whenexplicitly erased.  lisp-like garbage-collection schemes are free of this impediment.  they however,depend on being able to find and mark nodes that are reachable from program variables.  by tracing alldescendants from program variables may then be identified and collected.  the list-creating functionlist of slip may be amended to mark those lists for which the programmer wishes to assume responsibility. given this modification, a lisp-like garbage collector that recovers abandoned reentrant list structuresmay then be appended to the slip system.cacm july, weizenbaum, j..klist processing, slip, garbage-collection.c. .ca jb february ,   : am
