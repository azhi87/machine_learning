simulation of traffic flows in a network.wa computer simulation program which dealswith traffic flows in the network of a large area is described.  each road is segmented into blocks ofseveral ten-meter lengths and is represented by a bidirectional list in computer memory.  the movementof cars, i.e. the transfer of cars from one block to the next, is expressed by a proper formula.  thisformula is based on the supposition that the speed of cars in a block is determined only by the density ofcars in the block, and this speed-versus-density curve is empirically given the numerical values.  thissimulation scheme has its excellent point in that it makes it possible to trace the dynamic behaviorof traffic flows in a variety of situations, some examples of which are given for an actual area of the city of kyoto, japan.june, sakai, t.nagao, m..ktraffic simulation, traffic flow, traffic networktraffic control, traffic density, intersection, signal setting, vehicle, road network, list structure, computer simulation.c. .ca jb february ,   : pm
