an extension of the munkres algorithm forthe assignment problem to rectangular matrices.wthe assignment problem, together with munkresproposed algorithm for its solution in square matrices, is presented first.  then the authors developan extension of this algorithm which permits a solution for rectangular matrices.  timing resultsobtained by using an adapted version of silver's algol procedure are discussed, and a relation betweensolution time and problem size is given.cacm december, bourgeois, f.lassalle, j..koperations research, optimization theory, assignmentproblem, rectangular matrices, algorithm.c. .ca jb february ,   : am
