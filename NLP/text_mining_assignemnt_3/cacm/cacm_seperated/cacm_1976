multi-attribute retrieval with combined indexes.win this paper a file organization scheme designed toreplace the use of the popular secondary index filing scheme(or inverted files on secondary key fields) is described.through the use of redundancy and storing keys (or access numbers of the records) that satisfy different combinationsof secondary index values in "buckets," it is possible to retrieveall keys satisfying any input query derived from a subset offields by a single access to an index file, although each bucket maybe used for many combinations of values and a combination ofbuckets may be required for a given query.  the method which, in itsdegenerate case, becomes the conventional secondary index filingscheme works similarly but has the following advantages: () the eliminationof multiple accesses in many cases; () the eliminationof false drops; () the elimination of computer time to perform intersectionof key sets each qualified for one secondary index fieldonly; and () the avoidance of long strings of keys when an indexfield appearing in a query has very few possible values.  redundancy, in some cases, is the same as the secondary indexing method. in the general case, trade-off between the number of accesses for query and redundancy exists.cacm november, lum, v. y..kfile organization, secondary index files, inverted files, informationretrieval, data management, access method, secondary keys, storage with buckets, rapid retrieval, balanced filing scheme, eliminationof false drops, combining indexes, query, multi-attribute retrieval.c. . .ca jb february ,   : am
