a heuristic approach to inductive inference in fact retrieval systems.wheuristic procedures are presented which havebeen developed to perform inferences by generalizing from available information.  the procedures make useof a similarity structure which is imposed on the data base using nonnumerical clustering algorithms.  theyare implemented in a model fact retrieval system which uses a formal query language and a property-list datastructure.  a program of experiments is described wherein the procedures are used with test data baseswhich are altered by deleting part of the data and by purposely introducing false data.  it is found thatthe system can infer the correct response under a variety of conditions involving incomplete and inconsistent data.cacm december, skinner, c. w..kinference, inductive inference, clustering, fact retrieval, heuristics.c. . .ca jb january ,   : pm
