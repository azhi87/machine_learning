execution time requirements for encipherment programs.walthough encipherment has often been discussedas a means to protect computer data, its costs are not well established.  five experiments were conductedto measure the cpu time on a cdc  required by additive ciphers programmed both in assembly languageand in fortran: a "null transformation" to measure the time to move data without encipherment; enciphermentwith one-word key; encipherment with a -word key; double key encipherment; and encipherment usinga pseudo random key.  the results were analyzed for consistency over  runs, and the effects of constantand intermittent errors were considered.  timing rates for assembly language encipherment rangedfrom , characters per second for a pseudo random key cipher to ,, characters per secondfor a constant one-word key cipher.  the latter is almost equivalent to the rate required simply to movedata without encipherment.  fortran tests required over four times as much cpu time.  this paper introducesthe idea on enciphering time coefficient the ratio of enciphering time to the time taken tofetch and store data without encipherment.cacm august, friedman, t. d.offman, l. j..kencipherment, ciphers, security, privacy transformations,protection, cryptography, cryptology.c. . . . . .ca jb january ,   : am
