lg: a language for analytic geometry.wa conversational programming language for analyticgeometry is described, together with some aspects of its implementation.  the language allowsthe flexible definition of geometric objects and elements, computes their parameters, and displays the results.it also provides the capability of specifying a geometric figure via a collection of parameters anddisplaying various loci corresponding to these parameters. a third characteristic consists of the possibilityof using this language to design other user oriented languages.  lg has been specifically designedfor use by nonprogrammers; it is easy to learn and very close to the natural language used in geometry.cacm april, raymond, j..kinteractive programming, problem oriented languages,computer graphics, interpreters, analytic geometry.c. . . .ca jb january ,   : pm
