digital simulation of discrete flow systems*.wthe discrete flow systems discussed are characterizedby the movement of randomly arriving items along interacting channels.  programing a digitalcomputer to simulate such systems utilizes some techniques not common in other approaches to physicalproblems.  the principal portion of the paper is a discussion of two simulation studies that illustratesome of the programming problems involved. one is of an extensive package-handling plant, with theobjective being optimization of parameters such as storage capacities and processing rates.  in the other,air traffic flow and control procedures are simulated to compare the effects of alternative control decisions.cacm december, moore, c. j.lewis, t. s.ca jb march ,   : pm
