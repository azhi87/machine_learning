automatic derivation of microsentences.wthe decomposition of long complex english sentencesinto shorter kernel-like constituent sentences (microsentences)has often been suggested as an avenuetoward conducting automatic retrieval of natural language messages.  to explore the prospects of sucha step, the authors attempted in  to prepare a general program for deriving microsentences from longersentences that had been syntactically analyzed by the harvard multipath analysis program.  the basicidea was to extract the subject, verb and object (if any) of each clause and to reassemble these materialsinto a grammatical microsentence.  a program is described in this paper, which was designed to operateon the tree structure output of the analyzer, and the microsentences that were produced are exhibited. the authors conclude that while microsentences of the quality achieved do not open up immediate prospectsfor improving the performance of automatic message retrieval systems, they may have practicalvalue in man-machine systems using human monitors to select the preferred syntactic interpretation of a sentence.cacm june, carmody, b. tjones jr., p. e.ca jb march ,   : am
