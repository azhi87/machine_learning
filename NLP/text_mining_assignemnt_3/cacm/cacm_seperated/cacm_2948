a terminal-oriented communication system.wthis paper describes a system for full-duplexcommunication between a time-shared computer and its terminals.  the system consists of a communicationscomputer directly connected to the time-shared system, a number of small remote computers to whichthe terminals are attached, and connecting medium speed telephone lines.  it can service a large numberof terminals of various types.  the overall system design is presented along with the algorithms used tosolve three specific problems: local echoing, error detection and correction on the telephone lines,and multiplexing of character output.cacm july, heckel, p. g.lampson, b. w..kterminal system, error correction, multiplexing,local echoing, communication system, network.c. .ca jb december ,   : am
