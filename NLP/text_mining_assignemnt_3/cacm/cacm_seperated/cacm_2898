a conceptual framework for a nonprocedural programming language.wa sequential programming language forces theprogrammer to prescribe explicitly the order in which the operations in his program have to be executed,even if the order is not relevant to the solution of his problem.  the requirement to indicate irrelevantsequencing can be removed if the language provides facilities for specifying a task in a nonproceduralmanner.  in general, a program specified in this way will allow concurrent evaluation.  this paper describesa conceptual framework for a high level programming language providing both nonprocedural and sequentialfacilities.  within a program, nonprocedural and sequential program modules may be nested freely.cacm december, kessels, j. l. w..kparallel programming, descriptive programming,nonprocedural programming, definitional language, data flow programming, applicative programming.c.ca jb february ,   : am
