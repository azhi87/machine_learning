the sl procedure mechanism.wthis paper describes an integrated proceduremechanism that permits procedures to be used as recursive functions or as coroutines.  this integrationis accomplished by treating procedures and their activation records (called environments) as data objectsand by decomposing procedure invocation into three separate components at the source-language level. in addition, argument binding is under the control of the programmer, permitting the definition of variousmethods of argument transmission in the source language itself.  the resulting procedure mechanism,whichis part of the sl programming language, is well suited to goal-oriented problems and to other problemsthat are more readily programmed by using coroutines. several examples are given. cacm may, hanson, d.griswold, r.e..kprocedures, coroutines, programming languages,interpreters, snobol , backtracking.c. . . .ca dh february ,   : pm
