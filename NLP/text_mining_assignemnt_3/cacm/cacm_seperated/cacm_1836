a new method for determining linear precedencefunctions for precedence grammars.wthe precedence relations of a precedence grammar canbe precisely described by a two-dimensional precedence matrix.  often the information in the matrixcan be represented more concisely by a pair of vectors, called linear precedence functions.  a new algorithmis presented for obtaining the linear precedencefunctions when given the precedence matrix; this algorithmis shown to possess several computational advantages.cacm october, bell, j. r..kboolean matrices, syntax, precedence grammar context-freeparsing, transition matrix, precedence functions .c.ca jb february ,   : pm
