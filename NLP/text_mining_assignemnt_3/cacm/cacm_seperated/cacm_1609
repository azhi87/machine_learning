scheduling university course examinations by computer.wa new approach to the problem of schedulingcourse examinations is presented.  in principle, an examination schedule which requires a minimum numberof examination periods and satisfies the constraint that no student be required to take two examinationssimultaneously can be found in two steps.  first, course which may have their examinations scheduled atthe same period are grouped together in all possible ways.  then a minimum number of these groups, such thateach course is included at least once, are selected.  by removing multiple occurrences of courses and then schedulingeach group at a different period a minimal schedule can be obtained.  known algorithms for carryingout these procedures are prohibitively expensive.  approximations to the ideal procedure outlined above aregiven which yield nonminimal but feasible schedules with a very small expenditure of time.  results of experimentsusing these techniques are given.  these are encouraging and indicate that further experimentation would be worthwhile.cacm april, hall jr., a. d.acton, f. s.ca jb february ,   : am
