significance arithmetic on a digital computer.wthe  at nyu has been modified to includea "significance mode" of operation which is intended to facilitate the identification of significant bits inthe results of floating-point arithmetic operations.  the manner in which floating-point arithmetic is handledin this mode is discussed.  several numerical experiments using this mode are described and comparisonsare made with the ordinary "normalized mode."  examples include power series evaluation, linear equationssolution, determinant evaluation and matrix inversion.cacm march, goldstein, m.ca jb march ,   : pm
