computational aspects of multiple covarianceanalysis on a multifactor structure.wthe computational procedure for the analysisof multiple covariance in statistics is discussed with reference to the analysis of variance.  a specialoperator calculus developed by hartly for programming analysis of variance for multifactor experiments is extendedto cover the analysis of covariance.  this extension is accomplished by utilizing the connectionbetween the analysis of covariance and the analysis of variance and by introducing a new operator.  theresults are illustrated by a numerical example for analysis of covariance, in which the basic computationsare shown to be carried out by an analysis-of-variance program.cacm july, peng, k. c.ca jb march ,   : pm
