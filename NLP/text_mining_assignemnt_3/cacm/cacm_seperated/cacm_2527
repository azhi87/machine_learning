implementation of high level language machine.wcomputing machines which directly executethe statements of a high level language have been proposed in the past.  this report describes the actualimplementation of such a machine: it is a computer whose "machine language" is apl.  the machine is fullyoperational and correctly executes almost all of the apl operations on scalars, vectors, and arrays. the machine automatically allocates memory, executes statements, calls functions, converts numbers from onetype to another, checks subscripts, and automatically detects many types of programmer errors.cacm april, hassitt, a.lageschulte, j. w.lyon, l. e..kcomputer architecture, high level language machine,emulators, microprogramming, interpreters, execution speed, apl.c. .ca jb january ,   : am
