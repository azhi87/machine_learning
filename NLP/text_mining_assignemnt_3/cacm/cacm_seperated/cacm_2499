efficient multiprogramming resource allocation and accounting.walthough sometimes thought of as only a componentof time-sharing operation, multiprogramming can involve broader questions of resource allocation,since fairness is not required to meet a response criterion.  in a multiprogrammed system, it may servemaximal resource use to be unfair, for example by holding an input/output channel idle for a programwhile it completes a small amount of processor usage, enabling further use of the channel.  severalapplications of this principle are given, and it is suggested that a multiprogramming executive mightdynamically adjust its allocation algorithms to gain efficiency.  allocation of resources is closely connectedto accounting for those resources, raising the problems of repeatability, minimal uncharged overhead,and relative weighting of charges for dependent resources.  since weightings may depend on allocationalgorithms, these are not arbitrary accounting parameters.  often the only repeatable accounting isone which omits an extensive overhead will be paid, and should multiprogramming prove efficient, overchargeswill result.  multiprogramming turns on allocation of the memory resource essential to control of otherresources.  the general suggestions for allocation and accounting are applied to this question, and somedetails provided for the case of a monitor which controls a virtual-memory machine.cacm june, hamlet, r. g..kmonitor, executive, multiprogramming, efficiency,resource allocation, resource accounting.c.ca jb january ,   : pm
