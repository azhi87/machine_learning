detection of three-dimensional patterns of atoms in chemical structures.wan algorithm for detecting occurrences of a three-dimensional pattern ofobjects within a larger structure is presented.  the search techniquepresented uses the geometric structure of the pattern to definecharacteristics demanded of candidates for matching. this is usefulin cases where the properties of each atom, considered individually,do not adequately limit the number of sets of possible matchings.several applications of this technique in the field of chemistryare: () in pharmacology: searching for a common constellationof atoms in molecules possessing similar biological activities;() in x-ray crystallography: fitting a structure or a structural fragmentto a set of peaks in the electron-density distribution ofa fourier map; () in chemical documentation; retrieving froma file the structures containing specified substructures.cacm april, lesk, a.m..kthree-dimensional pattern recognition, chemicalstructure search, information retrieval, crystal-structure analysis, drug analysis and design.c. . .ca dh may ,   : am
