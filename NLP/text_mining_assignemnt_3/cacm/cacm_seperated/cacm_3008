preserving average proximity in arrays.wprogrammers and data structure designers are oftenforced to choose between alternative structures.  in storing these structures, preserving logical adjacenciesor "proximity" is usually an important consideration.  the combinatorial problem of storing arrays as variouskinds of list structures is examined.  embeddings of graphs are used to model the loss of proximity involvedin such storage schemes, and an elementary proof that arrays cannot be stored as linear lists withbounded loss of proximity is presented.  average loss of proximity is then considered, and it is shownthat arrays cannot be stored as linear lists with only bounded loss of average proximity, but can be sostored in binary trees.  the former result implies, for instance, that row major order is an asymptoticallyoptimal storage strategy for arrays.cacm march, demillo, r.a.eisenstat, s.c.lipton, r.j..karrays, graph embedding, linear lists,proximity, average proximity, trees.c. . . .ca jb march ,   : pm
