the selection of optimal tab settings.wa new generation of computer terminals allowstab settings to be selected and set by the computer.  this feature can be used to reduce the number of charactersthat are needed to represent a document for transmission and printing.  in this note, an algorithmis given for selecting the optimal set of tab stops for minimizing the number of characters transmitted. an implementation of the algorithm has reduced the number of characters transmitted by from to  percent, but requires a prepass through the document to compute a matrix used in determiningthe optimal set tab stops.  the use of fixed tab stops, as a heuristic alternative, can achieveabout  percent of optimal with no prepass. cacm december, peterson, j.l.bitner, j.r.howard, j.h..ktabs, word processing, dynamic programming.c. .ca dh january ,   : pm
