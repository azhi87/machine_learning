common phrases and minimum-space text storage.wa method for saving storage space for textstrings, such as compiler diagnostic messages, is described.  the method relies on hand selection of aset of text strings which are common to one or more messages.  these phrases are then stored only once. the storage technique gives rise to a mathematical optimization problem: determine how each message shoulduse the available phrases to minimize its storage requirement.  this problem is nontrivial when phraseswhich overlap exist.  however, a dynamic programming algorithm is presented which solves the problem in timewhich grows linearly with the number of characters in the text.  algorithm  applies to this paper.cacm march, wagner, r. a..kdiagnostic messages, error messages, common phrases,minimum space, text storage, optimization, dynamic programming.c. . .ca jb january ,   : pm
