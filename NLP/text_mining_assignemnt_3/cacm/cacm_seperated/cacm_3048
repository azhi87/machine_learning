performance evaluation of highly concurrentcomputers by deterministic simulation.wsimulation is presented as a practical techniquefor performance evaluation of alternative configurations of highly concurrent computers.  a techniqueis described for constructing a detailed deterministic simulation model of a system.  in the modela control stream replaces the instruction and data streams of the real system.  simulation of thesystem model yields the timing and resource usage statistics needed for performance evaluation, withoutthe necessity of emulating the system.  as a case study, the implementation of a simulator of a modelof the cpu-memory subsystem of the ibm / is described.  the results of evaluating some alternativesystem designs are discussed.  the experiments reveal that, for the case study, the major bottlenecksin the system are the memory unit and the fixed point unit.  further, it appears that many of the sophisticatedpipelining and buffering technique simplemented in the architecture of the ibm / are of littlevalue when high-speed (cache) memory is used, as in the ibm /.cacm november, kumar, b.davidson, e.s..kperformance evaluation, deterministic simulation,control stream, concurrent computers.c. .ca dh january ,   : am
