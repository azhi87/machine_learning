the quadratic hash method when the table size is not a prime number.wprevious work on quadratic hash methods islimited mainly to the case where the table size is a prime number.  here, certain results are derived forcomposite numbers.  it is shown that all composite numbers containing at least the square of one of the componentprimes have full-period integer-coefficient quadratic hash functions.cacm april, batagelj, v..kquadratic search, hash code, scatter storage, table size.c. .ca jb january ,   : pm
