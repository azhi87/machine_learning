permutation of data blocks in a bubble memory.wa common internal organization of bubble memories consists of a set of (minor) loops, connected through another (major) loop.  the problem of obtaining any give n permutation of the minor loop contents in minimum time is studiedin this paper.  a lower bound to the number of steps required buya permutation algorithm is derived, and the class of optimum algorithms is identified.cacm january, bongiovanni, g.c.luccio, f..kbubble memory, memory loops, permutation algorithm, data block shift.c. . .ca dh april ,   : pm
