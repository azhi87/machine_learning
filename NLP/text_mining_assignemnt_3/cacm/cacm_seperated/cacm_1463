more on extensible machines.wone of the most salient characteristics of extensiblemachines (em) is the facility for providing system control over program-to-program and program-to-datalinkage (e.g., address connection).  it is the intent of this paper to expand and clarify the remarksconcerning program-to-program and program-to-data linkage that were embodied in the authors' previouspaper on the em concepts, and to, finally, trace the employment of linkage mechanisms throughvarious levels of programming languages.cacm march, leonard, g. f.goodroe, j. r.ca jb march ,   : pm
