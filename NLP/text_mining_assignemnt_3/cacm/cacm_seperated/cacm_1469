the next  programming languages .wa family of unimplemented computing languagesis described that is intended to span differences of application area by a unified framework.  this frameworkdictates the rules about the uses of user-coined names, and the conventions about characterizing functionalrelationships.  within this framework the design of a specific language splits into two independentparts.  one is the choice of written appearances of programs (or more generally, their physical representation). the other is the choice of the abstract entities (such as numbers, character-strings, listsof them, functional relations among them) that can be referred to in the language.  the system is biasedtowards "expressions" rather than "statements."  it includes a nonprocedural(purely functional) subsystemthat aims to expand the class of users' needs that can be met by a single print-instruction, without sacrificingthe important properties that make conventional right-hand-side expressions easy to construct and understand.cacm march, landin, p. j.ca jb march ,   : pm
