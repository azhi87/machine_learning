comparison of several algorithms for computationof means, standard deviations and correlation coefficients.wseveral algorithms for computation of basicstatistics are compared by their performance on systematically generated test data.  the statisticscalculated were the mean, standard deviation and correlation coefficient.  for each statistic, the algorithmincluded the usual computing formulas, correction due to an accumulated error term, and a recursive computationof the current value of the statistic.  the usual computing formulas were also evaluated indouble precision.  large errors were noted for some calculation using the usual computing formulas.  the mostreliable technique was correction of the initial estimate by use of an accumulated error term.  to eliminatethe need for making two passes on the data, it was suggested that the initial estimate of themean be obtained from a subset of the data.cacm july, neely, p. m.ca jb march ,   : pm
