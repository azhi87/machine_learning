experiments with the m & n tree-searching program.wthe m & n procedure is an improvement to the mini-maxbacking-up procedure widely used in computer program for game-playingand other purposes.  it is based on the principle that it isdesirable to have many options when making decisions in the face ofuncertainty.  the mini-max procedure assigns to a max (min) nodethe value of the highest (lowest) valued successor to that node. the m & n procedure assigns to a max (min) node some function ofthe m (n) highest (lowest) valued successors.  an m & n procedure waswritten in lisp to play the game of kalah, and it was demonstrated that the m & n procedure is significantly superior to the mini-maxprocedure.  the statistical significance of important conclusions is given. since information on statistical significance has often been lacking in papers on computer experiments in the artificial intelligence field, these experiments can perhaps serve as a model for future work.cacm march, slagle, j. r.dixon, j. k..kartificial intelligence, heuristic program, tree searching,lisp, kalah, game playing, decision theory, mini-max backing-up procedure, backing-up procedures.c. . .ca jb february ,   : am
