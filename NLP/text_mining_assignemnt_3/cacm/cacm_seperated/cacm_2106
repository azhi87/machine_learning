computer education in a graduate school of management.wseveral years of experience have led to the belief that the creativedesign and evaluation of management information systems requiresa thorough understanding of the related computer technology.  conceptssuch as paging and priority interrupt systems can best be explained at the machine language level.  any machine used for expositionshould fulfill several criteria.  it should: () raise as fewspurious issues as possible; () allow, without undue effort, thesolution of interesting problems; () be capable of exposing alloutstanding issues of significance, capable of exposing all outstandingissues of significance, within the chosen machine; () beseful for pursuing issues in great depth when appropriate; () notbe committed to the equipment provided by any manufacturer; () be able to provide the student with diagnostic aids to a great depth;() allow the student ready access to the machine; () be capableof extension to expose new issues as they come along.  we haveconstructed a simulated machine and its associated software whichmeets these criteria.  this system, called the prism system,is documented by a primer and a reference manual.cacm february, ness, d. n.green, r. s.martin, w. a.moulton, g. a..keducation, simulation, machine language,management information systems, interpreters.c. . . .ca jb february ,   : am
