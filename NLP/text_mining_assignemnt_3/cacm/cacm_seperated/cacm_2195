on the optimal detection of curves in noisy pictures.wa technique for recognizing systems of linesis presented.  in this technique the heuristic of the problem is not embedded in the recognition algorithmbut is expressed in a figure of merit.   a multistage decision process is then able to recognizein the input picture the optimal system of lines according to the given figure of merit.  due to theglobal approach, greater flexibility and adequacy in the particular problem is achieved.  the relationbetween the structure of the figure of merit and the complexity of the optimization process is then discussed. the method described is suitable for parallel processing because the operations relative to eachstate can be computed in parallel, and the numberof stages is equal to the length n of the curves (orto log n if the approximate method is used).cacm may, montanari, u..kpicture processing, picture recognition, picturedescription, curve detection, line detection, edge detection,optimal detection, heuristic methods,global recognition, parallel processing, dynamic programming, interaction graph, secondary optimization problem.c. . .ca jb february ,   : pm
