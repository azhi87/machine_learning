a hardware architecture for implementing protection rings.wprotection of computations and informationis an important aspect of a computer utility.  in a system which uses segmentation as a memory addressingscheme, protection can be achieved in part by associating concentric rings of decreasing access privilegewith a computation.  this paper describes hardware processor mechanisms for implementing these ringsof protection.  the mechanisms for implementing these rings of protection. the mechanisms allow cross-ringcalls and subsequent returns to occur without trapping to the supervisor.  automatic hardware validationof references across ring boundaries is also performed.  thus, a call by a user procedure to a protectedsubsystem (including the supervisor) is identical to a call to a companion user procedure.  the mechanismsof passing and referencing arguments are the same in both cases as well.cacm march, schroeder, m. d.saltzer, j. h..kprotection, protection rings, protection hardware,access control, hardware access control, computer utility, time-sharing, shared information, segmentation, virtual memory, multics.c. .ca jb january ,   : pm
