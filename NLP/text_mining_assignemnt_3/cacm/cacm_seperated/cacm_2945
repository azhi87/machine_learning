certification of programs for secure information flow.wthis paper presents a certification mechanismfor verifying the secure flow of information through a program.  because it exploits the propertiesof a lattice structure among security classes, the procedure is sufficiently simple that it can easilybe included in the analysis phase of most existing compilers.  appropriate semantics are presented andproved correct.  an important application is the confinement problem: the mechanism can prove that a programcannot cause supposedly nonconfidential results to depend on confidential input data.cacm july, denning, d. e.denning, p. j..kprotection, security, information flow, program certification,lattice, confinement, security classes.c. . .ca jb december ,   : am
