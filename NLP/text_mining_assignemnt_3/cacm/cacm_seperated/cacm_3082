time, clocks, and the ordering of events in a distributed system.wthe concept of one event happening beforeanother in a distributed system is examined, andis shown to define a partial ordering of the events. a distributed algorithm is given for synchronizing a system of logical clocks which can be used to totallyorder the events.  the use of the total ordering is illustrated with a method for solving synchronizationproblems.  the algorithm is then specialized for synchronizing physical clocks, and a bound is derivedon how far out of synchrony the clocks can become.  cacm july, lamport, l..kdistributed systems, computer networks,clock synchronization, multiprocess systems.c. .ca dh february ,   : pm
