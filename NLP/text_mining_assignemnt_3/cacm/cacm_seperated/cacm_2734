on the external storage fragmentation producedby first-fit and best-fit allocation strategies.wpublished comparisons of the external fragmentationproduced by first-fit and best-fit memory allocation have not been consistent.  through simulation,a series of experiments were performed in order to obtain better data on the relative performance offirst-fit and best-fit and a better understanding of the reasons underlying observed differences. thetime-memory-product efficiencies of first-fit and best-fit were generally within  to  percent of eachother.  except for small populations, the size of the request population had little effect on allocationefficiency.  for exponential and hyperexponential distributions of requests, first-fit outperformed best-fit;but for normal and uniform distributions, and for exponential distributions distorted in variousways, best-fit outperformed first-fit.  it is hypothesized that when first-fit outperforms best-fit,it does so because first-fit, by preferentially allocating toward one end of memory, encourages large blocksto grow at the other end.  sufficient contiguous space is thereby more likely to be available for relativelylarge requests.  results of simulation experiments supported this hypothesis and showed that the relativeperformance of first-fit and best-fit depends on the frequency of request.  when the coefficient ofvariation of the request distribution is greater than or approximately equal to unity, first-fit outperformed best-fit.cacm august, shore, j. e..kstorage fragmentation, dynamic memory allocation, first-fit, best-fit.c. . .ca jb january ,   : am
