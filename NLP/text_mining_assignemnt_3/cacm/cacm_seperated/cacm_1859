error bounds for periodic quintic splines.wexplicit error bounds for periodic quintic splineinterpolation are developed.  the first (third) derivative of the periodic spline is shown to be a sixth(fourth) order approximation at the mesh points to the first (third) derivative of the function being interpolated.cacm august, hall, c. a..kspline, interpolation, error bounds.c. .ca jb february ,   : pm
