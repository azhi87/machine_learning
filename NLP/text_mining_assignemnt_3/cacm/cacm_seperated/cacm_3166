computing standard deviations: accuracy.wfour algorithms for the numerical computationof the standard deviation of (unweighted) sampled dataare analyzed.  two of the algorithms are well-known in the statisticaland computational literature; the other two are new algorithmsspecifically intended for automatic computation.  our discussion is expository, with emphasis on reaching a suitable definition of"accuracy."  each of the four algorithms is analyzed for the conditionsunder which it will be accurate.  we conclude that all fouralgorithms will provide accurate answers for many problems, but twoof the algorithms, one new, one old, are substantially more accurateon difficult problems than are the other two.cacm september, chan, t.f.lewis, j.g..kmean, standard deviation, least squares, updatingestimates, rounding error analysis, condition number..c. . .ca db january ,   : pm
