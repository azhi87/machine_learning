segment sizes and lifetimes in algol  programs.wthe characteristics of the virtual memory requirementsof a sample of algol  programs have been measured.  distributions are presented for thesizesof memory requests and for their holding times (lifetimes).  the results are presented in terms of johnston'scontour model and a simple abstract machine.  they provide new empirical evidence of certain aspectsof the construction and behavior of real programs, and some of their implications for the design of virtualmemory systems are presented and discussed.cacm january, batson, a. p.brundage, r. e..kvirtual memory, program behavior, segmentation,storage allocation, algol , contour model.c. . . .ca jb january ,   : am
