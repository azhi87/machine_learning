consecutive storage of relevant records with redundancy.wthis paper studies the properties of a newclass of file organizations (crwr) where records relevant to every query are stored in consecutive storagelocations but the organizations contain redundancy. some theorems which provide tools for reducing redundancyin crwr organizations have been also developed. redundancies obtained by the application of these theoremsare compared with that of query-inverted file organizations.  some crwr organization with minimum redundancyhave also been developed for queries which specify sets of keys.cacm august, ghosh, s. p..kconsecutive, retrieval, storage, file, records, query, redundancy, key.c. . .ca jb january ,   : pm
