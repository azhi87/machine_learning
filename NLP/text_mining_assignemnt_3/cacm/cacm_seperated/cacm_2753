a heuristic problem solving design systemfor equipment or furniture layouts.wthe designer problem solver (dps) demonstratesthat the computer can perform simple design tasks.  in particular, it designs furniture and equipmentlayouts.  this task was chosen because it is simple, well defined, and characteristic of many designtasks in architecture, engineering, urban planning, and natural resource management.  these space planningtasks usually involve manipulating two-dimensional representations of objects to create feasible or optimalsolutions for problems involving topological and metric spatial constraints.  the paper describesextensive tests performed on the program.  dps is a heuristic problem solver with a planning phase prefixedto it.  it uses the planning process to give it a sense of direction, diagnostic procedures to locatedifficulties, and remedial actions to recover from difficulties.  it uses a convex polygon representationto accurately describe the objects and the layout.  this representation allows topological andmetric constraints to be tested and the design to be easily updated.  dps has been applied to  problems. while it is slow and limited in scope, the ideas behind it are general.  it demonstrates the needfor selectivity in controlling search and the methods used to achieve it: task-specific information,planning, diagnostic procedures, remedial actions, and selective alternative generators.cacm may, pfefferkorn, c. e..kartificial intelligence, computer-aided design,design synthesis, diagnostic search, heuristics, planning, problem solving, representations, search strategies,space planning, spatial representations.c. . . .ca jb january ,   : pm
