general relativity and the application of algebraic manipulative systems.wthe paper describes some applications of symbolicalgebra systems to problems of general relativity including the derivation of the field equations, thepetrov classification of a metric, and the solution of the field equations in the presence of matter ina simple case.  attention is drawn to the strictly algebraic difficulties encountered in this work.cacm august, barton, d.fitch, j. p..ksymbolic mathematics,nonnumerical mathematics, generalrelativity, algebraic manipulation, equation manipulation.c. . .ca jb february ,   : pm
