the aed free storage package.wthe most fundamental underlying problem in sophisticatedsoftware systems involving elaborate, changing data structure is dynamic storage allocationfor flexible problem modeling.  the free storage package of the aed- compiler systems allows blocksof available storage to be obtained and returned for reuse.  the total available space is partitionedinto a hierarchy of free storage zones, each of which has its own characteristics.  blocks may be ofany size, and special provisions allow efficient handling of selected sizes, control of shattering andgarbage collection, and sharing of physical space between zones.  the routines of the package performhigh level functions automatically, but also allow access and control of fine internal details as well.cacm august, ross, d. t.ca jb february ,   : pm
