optimizing the performance of a relational algebra database interface.wan approach for implementing a "smart" interfaceto support a relational view of data is proposed.  the basic idea is to employ automatic programming techniquesso that the interface analyzes and efficiently refines the high level query specification supplied bythe user.  a relational algebra interface, called squiral, which was designed using this approach, is describedin detail. squiral seeks to minimize query response time and space utilization by: () performingglobal query optimization, () exploiting disjoint and pipelined concurrency, () coordinating sort ordersin temporary relations, () employing directory analysis, and () maintaining locality in page references. algorithms for implementing the operators of e. f. codd's relational algebra are presented, anda methodology for composing them to optimize the performance of a particular user query is described.cacm october, smith, j. m.yen-tang chang, p..krelational database, database optimization, invertedfile, automatic programming, query language, data manipulation language, very high level language.c. . .ca jb january ,   : am
