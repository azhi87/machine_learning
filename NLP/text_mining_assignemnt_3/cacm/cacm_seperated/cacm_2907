the optimal approach to recursive programs.wthe classical fixed poin t approach toward recursiveprograms suggests choosing the "least defined fixed poin t" as the most appropriate solution to a recursiveprogram.  a new approach is described which in troduction an " optimal fixed point," which, in contrastto the least defined fixed poin t, embodies the maximal amount of valuable information embedded in theprogram.  the practical implications of this approach are discussed and techniques for proving propertiesof optimal fixed poin t are given.  the presentation is informal, with emphasis on examples.cacm november, manna, z.shamir, a..krecursive programs, fixed poin ts, least fixedpoints,optimal fixed poin ts, proof techniques.c.ca jb december ,   : am
