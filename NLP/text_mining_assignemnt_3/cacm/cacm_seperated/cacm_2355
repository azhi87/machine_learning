implementing clenshaw-curtis quadrature, i methodology and experience.wclenshaw-curtis quadrature is a particularlyimportant automatic quadrature scheme for a variety of reasons, especially the high accuracy obtained fromrelatively few integrand values.  however, it has received little use because it requires the computationof a cosine transformation and the arithmetic cost of this has been prohibitive.  this paper is intwo parts; a companion paper, "ii computing the cosine transformation," shows that this objection canbe overcome by computing the cosine transformation by a modification of the fast fourier transform algorithm. this first part discusses the strategy and various error estimates, and summarizes experiencewith a particular implementation of the scheme.cacm may, gentleman, w. m..kclenshaw curtis, numerical integration, automaticquadrature, error estimates, chebyshev series.c.ca jb january ,   : am
