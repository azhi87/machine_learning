faster retrieval from context trees (corrigendum).wcontext trees provide a convenient way ofstoring data which is to be viewed as a hierarchy of contexts.  this note presents an algorithm which improveson previous context tree retrieval algorithms. it is based on the observation that in typical uses contextchanges are infrequent relative to retrievals, so that data can be cached to speed up retrieval.  a retrievalis started from the position of the previous retrieval and auxiliary structures are built up to makethe search rapid.  algorithms for addition and deletion of data and for garbage collection are outlined.cacm september, wegbreit, b..kcontext trees, frame problem, variable bindings, data structures.c. . .ca jb january ,   : am
