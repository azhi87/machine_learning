a new integration algorithm for ordinary differentialequations based on continued fraction approximations.wa new integration algorithm is found, and animplementation is compared with other programmed algorithms.  the new algorithm is a step-by-step procedurefor solving the initial value problem in ordinary differential equations.  it is designed to approximatepoles of small integer order in the solutions of the differential equations by continued fractions obtainedby manipulating the sums of truncated taylor series expansions.  the new method is compared withgragg-bulirsh-stoer, and the taylor series method.  the taylor series method and the new method are shownto be superior in speed and accuracy, while the new method is shown to be most superior when the solutionis required near a singularity.  the new method can finally be seen to pass automatically through singularitieswhere all the other methods which are discussed will have failed.cacm september, willers, i. m..kordinary differential equations, initial value problem,integration, taylor series, singularities, continued fractions, program comparison.c.ca jb january ,   : am
