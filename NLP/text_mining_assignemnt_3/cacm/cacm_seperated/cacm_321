algol  confidential.wthe algol  report,* when first encountered,seems to describe a very complex language which will be difficult to learn.  the "metalinguistic formulae"admirably serve the purpose of precisely specifying a language, but they are certainly not very readablefor a beginner.  however, experience has shown that once the report is explained it is in fact easy to learnalgol and to write algorithms in it.  the language is so general and powerful it can handle an enormousclass of problems.  it is not hard to learn those parts of algol present in other compiler languages: howto write assignment and go to and for statements, etc.  indeed, a lot of the unnecessary restrictionsimposed by other compiling languages have finally been lifted.  but algol also allows many unobvious thingsto be written, as we will see later, and herein lies a problem: algol seems to have become too general. so many restrictions have been lifted that a lot of technical details crop up which are hard to learnand to use correctly.  in this paper some of the more obscure features of the language are consideredand their usefulness is discussed.  remarks are based on the authors' interpretations of the algol  report.cacm june, knuth, d. e.merner, j. n.ca jb march ,   : pm
