on the interface between computers and data communications systems.wfuture systems that combine computers, digitalterminals, and communications equipment present design optimization problems that require reconsiderationof the traditional functional responsibilities of the respective subsystems.  several "standard" interfaces,by means of which computers and digital terminals connect to the communications systems willbe required.  when specifying these interfaces, consideration must be given to problems of coordination,synchronization, error control, signaling, stream multiplexing, and switch control, in addition to minimizingthe technological interdependence of specific subsystem designs.  a focus on some of the problems isobtained in a discussion of a detailed specification for a particular computer-communications system interface.cacm july, fraser, a. g..kcommunications, standard interface communicationsprotocol, virtual channel, multiplexed input/output, coordination of input/output.c. . .ca jb january ,   : pm
