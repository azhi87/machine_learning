an optimal insertion algorithm for one-sidedheight-balanced binary search trees.wan algorithm for inserting an element into a one-sided height-balanced(oshb) binary search tree is presented.  the algorithm operates in time o(log n), where n is the number of nodes inthe tree.  this represents an improvement over the best previously known insertion algorithms of hirschberg and kosaraju, which requiretime o(log n).  moreover, the o(log n) complexity is optimal. earlier results have shown that deletion in such a structure canalso be performed in o(log n) time.  thus the result of this papergives a negative answer to the question of whether such trees shouldbe the first examples of their kind, where deletion has a smaller time complexity than insertion.  furthermore, it can now be concludedthat insertion, deletion, and retrieval in oshb trees canbe performed in the same time as the corresponding operations forthe more general avl trees, to within a constant factor.  however,the insertion and deletion algorithms for oshb trees appear muchmore complicated than the corresponding algorithms for avl trees.cacm september, raiha,k.j.zweben, s.h..kinsertion, one-sided height-balanced trees, height-balancedtrees, binary trees, search trees..c.. . . . .ca db january ,   : am
