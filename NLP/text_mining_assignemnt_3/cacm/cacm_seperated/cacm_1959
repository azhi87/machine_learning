an interrupt based organization for management information systems.wa programming structure, language constructs, and a supervisory system organization are proposedfor the design and coding of large shared data base systems.  thebases for this organization are a generalized interrupt structureand the newly introduced concept of "file tagging," which is theprocess of associating program structures and interrupt generatingconditions with items in the data base.  an algorithm for resolvingconflicts which arise in scheduling the interrupt processing routinesis presented.  dpl, a programming language and supervisorysystem in which these concepts are implemented, is used to illustratedthe new organization which is proposed for management information systems.cacm december, morgan, h. l..kmanagement information systems, integrated data processing,supervisors, interrupts monitoring systems, supervisorysystems, interrupt scheduling, parallel processing.c. . .ca jb february ,   : pm
