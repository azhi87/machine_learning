a method of syntax-checking algol .wa syntax checker was designed based on the syntaxof algol as described in the algol  report [communications of the acm, may, ].  since the definitionof the elements of the language is recursive it seemed most desirable to design the syntax checkeras a set of mutually recursive processors tied together by subroutines which perform certain bookkeepingfunctions.  because of the recursive nature of the language and of the syntax checker the problemof recovery after an error required much attention.  a method was devised which permits most programsto be checked completely despite errors.cacm august, lietzke, m. p.ca jb march ,   : pm
