on the computation of least squares polynomials.wrounding error accumulated during digital computationof a least squares polynomial makes the computed polynomial only an approximation to the true leastsquare polynomial.  a simple method for adjust ing the constant term of the computed polynomial to geta better approximation to the true least squares polynomial is described.cacm january, goldberg, m.ca jb february ,   : pm
