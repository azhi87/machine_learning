boolean matrix methods for the detection of simple precedence grammars.wa mechanical procedure is derived for determiningwhether a given context-free phrase structure grammar is a simple precedence grammar.  this procedureconsists of elementary operations on suitably defined boolean matrices.  application of theprocedure to operator grammars is also given.cacm october, martin, d. f..ksyntax analysis, precedence analysis, simple precedencegrammar, simple precedence language, operator grammar, operator precedence, compilers, bounded-contextsyntactic analysis, boolean matrices, relations.c. .ca jb february ,   : pm
