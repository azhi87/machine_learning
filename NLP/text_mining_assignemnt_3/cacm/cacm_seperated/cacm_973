estimation of heart parameters using skin potential measurements.wa fundamental problem of vector cardiographyis the estimation of the state of the heart on the basis of skin potential measurements.  a mathematicalmodel relating ventricular dipoles to surface potentials is sketched.  then it is shown that the inverseproblem-that of determining electrical heart parameters on the basis of skin potential measurements-maybe viewed as a nonlinear multipoint boundary value problem.  a feasible solution, employing quasilinearizationand high-speed digital computers, is given.cacm november, bellman, r.collier, c.kagiwada, h.kalaba, r.selvester, r.ca jb march ,   : pm
