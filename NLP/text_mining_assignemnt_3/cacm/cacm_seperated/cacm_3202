   manip: a computer system for algebra and analytic differentiation.w   a mathematical expression to be operated upon is written in fortran-like notation and stored in the computer as a string of bcd characters with allblanks removed. it may be as complicated as desired (parentheses nested withoutrestriction, etc.) so long as the entire expression (or any subsequent form)does not exceed  characters. the problemm of performing algebraic operationsand obtaining analytic derivatives was translated into that of identifying andmanipulating character sequences. programs which resulted were written infortran iv for a cdc  and are discussed in detail.cacm august, bender, b.ca es march ,  : am
