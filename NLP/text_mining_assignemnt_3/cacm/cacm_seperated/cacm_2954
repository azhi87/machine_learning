a bounded storage algorithm for copying cyclic structures.wa new algorithm is presented which copies cycliclist structures using bounded workspace and linear time. unlike a previous similar algorithm, thisone makes no assumptions about the storage allocation system in use and uses only operations likely to be availablein a high-level language.  the distinctive feature of this algorithm is a technique for traversingthe structure twice, using the same spanning tree in each case, first from left to right and then from right to left.cacm june, robson j. m..kcopying, shared subtrees, cyclic structures.c. .ca jb december ,   : pm
