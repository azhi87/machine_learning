on a solution to the cigarette smoker'sproblem (without conditional statements).wthis report discusses a problem first introducedby patil, who has claimed that the cigarette smoker's problem cannot be solved using the p and v operationsintroduced by dijkstra unless conditional statements are used.  an examination of patil's proofshows that he has established this claim only under strong restrictions on the use of p and v.  these restrictionseliminate programming techniques used by dijkstra and others since the first introductionof the semaphore concept.  this paper contains a solution to the problem.  it also discusses the needfor the generalized operators suggested by patil.cacm march, parnas, d. l..koperating systems, co-operating processes,processsynchronization primitives.c.ca jb january ,   : pm
