a program data flow analysis procedure.wthe global data relationships in a programcan be exposed and codified by the static analysis methods described in this paper.  a procedure is givenwhich determines all the definitions which canpossibly "reach" each node of the control flow graphof the program and all the definitions that are "live" on each edge of the graph.  the procedure usesan "interval" ordered edge listing data structure and handles reducible and irreducible graphs indistinguishably.cacm march, allen, j. e.cocke, j..kprogram optimization, data flow analysis,flow graphs, algorithms, compilers.c. .ca jb january ,   : am
