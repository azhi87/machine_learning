an information algebra - phase i report-languagestructure group of the codasyl development committee.wthis report represents the results of thefirst phase of the work of the language structure group.  the goal of this work is to arrive at a properstructure for a machine-independent problem-defining language, at the systems level of data processing.  thereport is based, for the most part, on a mathematical model called "an information algebra" developed primarilyby r. bosak.  it is hoped that this report will be read (a) with avid interest by programming languagedesigners and implementors, and all those interested in developing a theoretical approach to dataprocessing; (b) with interest and understanding by professional programmers and systems analysts; and (c)with appreciation by the businessman-analyst-manager.  the authors have not attempted an exhaustive discoursein this report.  rather, they have tried to present a philosophy to the professional people who are vitallyconcerned with providing a working language for the systems analyst's use.  they trust that the ideasin this report will stimulate others to think along similar lines.  questions and comments will be welcomed,and can be addressed to any of the members of the language structure group:  robert bosak, systemdevelopment corporation;  richard f. clippinger, honeywell edp division;  carey dobbs, remington randunivac division;  roy goldfinger (chairman), ibm corporation;  renee b. jasper, navy management office; william keating, national cash register;  george kendrick, general electric company;  jean e. sammet, ibm corporation.cacm april, ca jb march ,   : pm
