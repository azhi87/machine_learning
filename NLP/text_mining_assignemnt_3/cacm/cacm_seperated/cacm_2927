some new upper bounds on the generation of prime numbers.wgiven an integer n, what is the computationalcomplexity of finding all the primes less than n?  a modified sieve of eratosthenes using doubly linkedlists yields an algorithm of o(n) arithmetic complexity.  this upper bound is shown to be equivalentto the theoretical lower bound for sieve methods without preprocessing.  use of preprocessing techniquesinvolving space-time and additive-multiplicative tradeoffs reduces this upper bound to o(n/log logn)and the bit complexity to o(n logn log log logn).  a storage requirement is described using o(n logn/log logn) bits as well.cacm september, mairson, h. g..kcomputational complexity, sieve, prime number generation,number theory, linked list, preprocessing, balancing.c. .ca jb december ,   : pm
