automatic integration of a function with a parameter.wtwo efficient methods for automatic numericalintegration are romberg integration and adaptive simpson integration.  for integrands of the form f(x)g(x,a)where a is a parameter, it is shown that romberg's method is more efficient.  a fortran programshows how to achieve this greater efficiency.cacm november, rabinowitz, p.ca jb march ,   : pm
