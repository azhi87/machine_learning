price/performance patterns of u.s. computer systems.weconometric models of the u.s. computer market have been developed to study the relationships between system price and hardware performance.  singlemeasures of price/performance such as "grosch's law" are shown tobe so over simplified as to be meaningless.  multiple-regression modelspredicting system cost as a function of several hardwarecharacteristics do, however, reveal a market dichotomy.  on one hand thereexists a stable, price predictable market for larger, generalpurpose computer systems.  the other market is the developing onefor small business computer systems, a market which is relativelyunstable with low price predictability. cacm april, cale, e.g.gremillion, l.l.mckenney, j.l..kprice/performance, grosch's law, u.s. computer market.c. . .ca dh may ,   : pm
