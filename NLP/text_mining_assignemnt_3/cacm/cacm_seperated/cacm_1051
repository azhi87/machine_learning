multiword list items.wthe list concept as originally proposed bynewell, simon and shaw specified single computer words as elements of a list.  this report describes theuse of two or more consecutive words as one element.  such use results in a considerable saving in both thespace required to hold a given amount of data, and in the execution time required to perform a givenprocess on the data.  following a brief description of standard list structures with single-word items, themultiword items are introduced.  then variable-length items are described, along with the corresponding space-utilizationproblems.  finally, several examples are given to illustrate the use of multiword lists. thispaper attempts to draw together various recent papers which have applied some of these concepts in differentways, and indicate how they relate to the more general problems.cacm june, comfort, w. t.ca jb march ,   : pm
