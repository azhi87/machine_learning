blocks-a new data type for snobol.wa new data type, called a block, has been implementedfor snobol.  a block is a three-dimensional aggregate of characters in the form of a right parallelepiped,best thought of as a three-dimensional extension to a string.  (the third dimension is used foroverstriking.)  blocks may be printed, concatenated in any of three dimensions, and merged on the basisof program-defined connection points.  some blocks adapt in size and shape to their environment.  blocksand their operations are mainly used for composing printable output.  a variety of graphical problems (includingflowcharting, bargraphs, logic diagrams, mathematical-equation formation, and text justificationand preparation) have been programmed on a printer in what appears to be an easy and natural way.  in additionto these somewhat specialized applications, blocks appear to be a good general purpose device-independentoutput formation mechanism especially suitable for nonnumerical work.  the concept of a block is largelylanguage independent.that is, blocks require little in the way of specialized syntax and could readilybe absorbed into the external structure of most programming languages.cacm june, gimpel, j. f..kcharacter manipulation, output formatting, stringprocessing, graphics, nonnumerical programming, snobol, data types, two-dimensional mathematics, test processing, flowcharting.c. .ca jb january ,   : pm
