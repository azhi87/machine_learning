neater: a pl/i source statement reformatter.wneater accepts a pl/i source program and operates on it to producea reformatted version.  when in the logical mode, neater indicatesthe logical structure of the source program in the indentationpattern of its output.  logic errors discovered through neaterlogical analysis are discovered much more economically than is possiblethrough compilation and trial runs.  a number of options areavailable to give the user full control over the output format andto maximize the utility of neater as an aid during the earlystages of development of a pl/i source deck.  one option, usage, causesneater to insert into each logical unit of coding a statementwhich will case the number of times each one is executed to be recordedduring execution.  this feature is expected to provide amajor aid in optimization of pl/i programs.cacm november, conrow, k.smith, r. g..klogical analysis of pl/i source, reformatting of pl/isource, documentation aid, execution time usage data.c. . . .ca jb february ,   : am
