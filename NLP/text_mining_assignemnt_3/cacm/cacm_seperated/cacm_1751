the working set model for program behavior.wprobably the most basic reason behind the absenceof a general treatment of resource allocation in modern computer systems is an adequate model forprogram behavior.  in this paper a new model, the "working set model," is developed. the working setof pages associated with a process, defined to be the collection of its most recently used pages, providesknowledge vital to the dynamic management of paged memories.  "process" and "working set" are shown tobe manifestations of the same ongoing computational activity; then "processor demand" and "memory demand"are defined; and resource allocation is formulated as the problem of balancing demands against available equipment.cacm may, denning, p. j..kgeneral operating system concepts, multiprocessing,multiprogramming, operating systems, program behavior, program models, resource allocation, scheduling, storage allocation.c. .ca jb february ,   : am
