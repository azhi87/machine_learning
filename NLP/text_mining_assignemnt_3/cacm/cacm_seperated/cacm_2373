properties of the working-set model.wa program's working set w(t,t) at time t isthe set of distinct pages among the t most recently referenced pages.  relations between the average working-set size,the missing-page rate, and the interreference-interval distribution may be derived both from time-average definitionsand from ensemble-average (statistical) definitions. an efficient algorithm for estimating thesequantities is given.  the relation to lru (least recently used) paging is characterized.  the independent-referencemodel, in which page references are statistically independent, is used to assess the effectsto interpage dependencies on working-set size observations. under general assumptions, working-setsize is shown to be normally distributed.cacm march, denning, p. j.schwartz, s. c..kworking-set model, paging, paging algorithms,program behavior, program modeling.c.ca jb january ,   : pm
