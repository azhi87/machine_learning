a modified inversion procedure for productform of the inverse linear programming codes.wthis paper describes a new algorithm for theselection of the pivot row in matrix inversion when using the product form of the inverse.  this algorithmhas been developed for linear programming codes; however, it would be valuable for the inversionof any non-dense matrix.  the procedures described in this paper have been thoroughly tested and have beenin operation on the esso research and engineering ibm  computer for nine months.  substantial computercost savings have been realized because of this procedure.cacm july,larsen, l. j.ca jb march ,   : pm
