toward an understanding of data structures.wthis paper presents a notation and formalismfor describing the semantics of data structures.  this is based on directed graphs with named edges andtransformations on these graphs.  in addition, an implementation facility is described which couldbe part of a programming language, which allows a programmer who has expressed the semantics of an algorithmin terms of the graphs to then specify the implementation of some of his data structures in order to gain efficiency.cacm october,earley, j..kdata structures, graph, implementation,semantic formalism, programming language.c. . .ca jb february ,   : pm
