an empirical study of list structure in lisp.wstatic measurements of the list structure offive large lisp programs are reported and analyzed in this paper.  these measurements reveal substantialregularity, or predictability, among poin ters to atoms and especially among poin ters to lists.  pointersto atoms are found to obey, roughly, zipf's law, which governs word frequencies in natural languages; poin tersto lists usually poin t to a location physically nearby in memory.  the use of such regularities in thespace-efficient representation of list structure is discussed.  linearization of lists, whereby successivecdrs (or cars) are placed in consecutive memory locations whenever possible, greatly strengthens theobserved regularity of list structure.  it is shown that under some reasonable assumptions, the entropy orinformation content of a car-cdr pair in the programs measured is about  to  bits before linearization,and about  to  bits after.cacm february, clark, d. w.green, c. c..klist structure measurement, lisp, list structureregularity, poin ter compression, zipf's law, list linearization, poin ter entropy.c. . . . .ca jb december ,   : am
