synchronizing processors with memory-content-generated interrupts.wimplementations of the "lock-unlock" methodof synchronizing processors in a multiprocessor system usually require uninterruptable, memory-pause type instructions. an interlock scheme called read-interlock, which does not require memory-pause instructions, hasbeen developed for a dual dec pdp- system with real-time requirements.  the read-interlock method doesrequire a special"read-interlock" instruction in the repertoire of the processors and a special "read-interlock"cycle in the repertoire of the memory modules.  when a processor examines a "lock" (a memorylocation) with a read-interlock instruction, it will be interrupted if the lock was already set; examininga lock immediately sets it if it was not already set (this event sequence is a read-interlock cycle). writing into a lock clears it.  having the processor interrupted upon encountering a set lock instead ofbranching is advantageous if the branch would have resulted in an effective interrupt.cacm june, hill, j. c..kinterrupts,supervisors, monitors, debugging, parallelprocessing, associative memories, microprogramming.c. .ca jb january ,   : pm
