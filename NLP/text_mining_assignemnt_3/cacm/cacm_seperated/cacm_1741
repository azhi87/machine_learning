brad: the brookhaven raster display.wa multiconsole computer display system hasbeen designed that provides very rich displays at low unit cost.  each brad (brookhaven raster display)console can plot tens of thousands of points, or up to  characters at  frames per second.  afteran initial display system investment of $, each display, with teletype, costs less than $,. the technique employed is that of programmatically generating a binary image of the desired display in acomputer.  the image is written on a rotating drum memory.  independent read heads continuously displaythe picture, which is generated by swept horizontal lines.  a standard tv monitor serves as the display device. the technique has two drawbacks.  a computer must compute any image to be displayed.  also, the "pointing"interaction is more difficult.  this is because the pointing function gives only the coordinatesof the point on the screen.  the inverse of the map generation process is required to calculatethe coordinates of the point on the screen.  the inverse of the map generation process is required tocalculate the coordinates at the selected point in the input space.cacm june, ophir, d.rankowitz, s.shepherd, b. j.spinrad, r. j..kcomputer display, computer graphics, computer rasterdisplay, tv display console, digital tv display, swept raster computer display, swept raster tv computerdisplay, tv graphics terminal, multiconsole computer graphics, inexpensive graphic terminal.c. . .ca jb february ,   : pm
