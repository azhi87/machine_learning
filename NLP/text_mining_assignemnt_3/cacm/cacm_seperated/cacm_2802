the new math of computer programming.wstructured programming has proved to be an importantmethodology for systematic program design and development.  structured programs are identifiedas compound function expressions in the algebra of functions. the algebraic properties of these functionexpressions permit the reformulation (expansion as well as reduction) of a nested subexpression independentlyof its environment, thus modeling what is known as stepwise program refinement as well as programexecution.  finally, structured programming is characterized in terms of the selection and solutionof certain elementary equations defined in the algebra of functions.  these solutions can be given ingeneral formulas, each involving a single parameter, which display the entire freedom availablein creating correct structured programs.cacm january, mills, h. d..kstructured programming, algebra of functions,stepwise refinement, program correctness.c. . .ca jb january ,   : am
