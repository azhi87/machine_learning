multiprogramming stretch: feasibility considerations.wthe tendency towards increased parallelism incomputers is noted.  exploitation of this parallelism presents a number of new problems in machine designand in programming systems.  minimum requirements for successful concurrent execution of several independentproblem programs are discussed.  these requirements are met in the stretch system by a carefully balancedcombination of built-in and programmed logic.  techniques are described which place the burden of theprogrammed logic on system programs (supervisory program and compiler) rather than on problem programs.cacm november, codd, e. f.lowry, e. s.mcdonough, e.scalzi, c. a.ca jb march ,   : pm
