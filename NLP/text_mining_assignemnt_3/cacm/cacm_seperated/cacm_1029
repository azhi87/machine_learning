a simple automatic derivative evaluation program.wa procedure for automatic evaluation of total/partialderivatives of arbitrary algebraic functions is presented.  the technique permits computation ofnumerical values of derivatives without developing analytical expressions for the derivatives.  the keyto the method is the decomposition of the given function, by introduction of intermediate variables,into a series of elementary functional steps.  a library of elementary function subroutines is providedfor the automatic evaluation and differentiation of these new variables.  the final step in this processproduces the desired function's derivative.  the main feature of this approach is its simplicity. it can be used as a quick-reaction tool where the derivation of analytical derivatives is laborious andalso as a debugging tool for programs which contain derivatives.cacm august, wengert, r. e.ca jb march ,   : pm
