shift-register code for indexing applications.win this communication the use of a shift-registercode with n =  is described for calling  wireless telemetering stations in a fixed cyclical order. a high degree of redundancy is used, permitting a single-error correcting code ("minimum-distance-three"code) with  -bit code words to be employed as the station identification code.  embedding this inthe shift-register code with period  permits the code to be employed without punctuation, each ofthe telemetering station receivers simply putting received ones and zeros into a shift register.  eachtime the given code combination arises identifying the particular station (barring for tuitous error combinationsof very low probability) it has been called.  the communication describes the properties and applicationof the code in some detail and the finding of the particular example to be employed on ural, thesoviet-built drum computer donated to the indian statistical institute by the united nationstechnical aid administration (untaa).cacm october, nadler, m.sengupta, a.ca jb march ,   : pm
