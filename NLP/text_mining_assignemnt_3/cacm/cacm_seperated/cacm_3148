high level programming for distributed computing.wprogramming for distributed and other loosely coupled systemsis a problem of growing interest.  this paper describes an approachto distributed computing at the level of general purpose programminglanguages.  based on primitive notions of module, message,and transaction key, the methodology is shown to be independentof particular languages and machines.  it appears to be useful forprogramming a wide range of tasks.  this is part of an ambitiousprogram of development in advanced programming languages, and relationswith other aspects of the project are also discussed.cacm june, feldman, j.a..kdistributed computing, modules, messages, assertions.c. .ca dh august ,   : pm
