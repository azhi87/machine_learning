stable numerical methods for obtaining the chebyshevsolution to an overdetermined system of equations.wan implementation of stiefel's exchange algorithmfor determining a chebyshev solution to an overdetermined system of linear equations is presented,that uses gaussian lu decomposition with row interchanges.  the implementation is computationally morestable than those usually given in the literature.  a generalization of stiefel's algorithm is developed whichpermits the occasional exchange of two equations simultaneously.cacm june, bartels, r. h.golub, g. h..kchebyshev solutions, overdetermined linearsystems, linear equations,exchange algorithm.c. . .ca jb february ,   : pm
