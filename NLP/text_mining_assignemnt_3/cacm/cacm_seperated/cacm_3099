new sufficient optimality conditions forinteger programming and their application.wthe purpose of this report is to present anew class of sufficient optimality conditions for pure and mixed integer programming problems.  some ofthe sets of sufficient conditions presented can be thought of as generalizations of optimality conditionsbased on primal-dual complementarity in linear programming.  these sufficient conditions are particularlyuseful for the construction of difficult integer programming problems with known optimal solutions.  theseproblems may then be used to test and/or "benchmark" integer programming codes.cacm may, fleisher, j.m.meyer, r.r..kinteger programming, optimality conditions, testproblem construction, kuhn-tucker conditions, greatest common divisor .c. . .ca dh february ,   : pm
