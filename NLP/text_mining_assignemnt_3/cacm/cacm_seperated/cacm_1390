convert.wa programming language is described whichis applicable to problems conveniently described by transformation rules.  by this is meant that patternsmay be prescribed, each being associated with a skeleton, so that a series of such pairs may be searcheduntil a pattern is found which matches an expression to be transformed.  the conditions for a matchare governed by a code which also allows subexpressions to be identified and eventually substituted into thecorresponding skeleton.  the primitive patterns and primitive skeletons are described, as well as theprinciple which allow their elaboration in to more complicated patterns and skeletons.  the advantages of thelanguage are that it allows one to apply transformation rules to lists and arrays as easily as strings, that bothpatterns and skeletons may be defined recursively, and that as a consequence programs may be stated quite concisely.cacm august, guzman, a.mcintosh, h. v.ca jb march ,   : pm
