event manipulation for discrete simulationsrequiring large numbers of events.wthe event-manipulation system presented here consists oftwo major parts.  the first part addresses the familiar problem of event scheduling efficiencywhen the number of scheduled events grows large.  the second part deals with the less apparent problemof providing efficiency and flexibility as scheduled events are accessed to be executed.  additional featuresand problems dealt with include the proper handling of simultaneous events; that certain events must be created,scheduled, and executed at the same points in simulated time; that infinite loops caused by the concatenationof such "zero-time" events are possible and must be diagnosed; that maintaining various eventcounts is practical and economical; and that a capability for handling  "time-displaceable" events is desirable and possible.  cacm september, ulrich, e.g..ksimulation, discrete systems simulation, discreteevent simulation, time-flow mechanisms.c. . . .ca dh january ,   : pm
