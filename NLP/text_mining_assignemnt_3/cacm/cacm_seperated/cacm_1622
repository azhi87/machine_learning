an efficient procedure for the generation of closed subsets.wan efficient algorithm is described for generatingsubsets of a set s which satisfy constraints of the form: "if s(i) is a member of the subset, thens(j) must also be a member of the subset."  the algorithm has been programmed in the wisp language andsuccessfully run on the ibm  in connection with a routine to detect feedback in multidimensional iterative networks.cacm march, waite, w. m.ca jb february ,   : pm
