computer construction of project networks.wproject networks are used in pert and cpm. an algorithm is given for constructing project networks directly from the project precedence relations. the algorithm creates "dummy" activities and topologically orders the arcs and nodes.  the number ofnodes created is minimal for the given precedence relations.  it has been experimentally programmedin fortran ii for the ibm .cacm july, fisher, a. c.liebman, j. s.nemhauser, g. l..kproject networks, pert, cpm, topologicalordering, network construction by computer.c.ca jb february ,   : pm
