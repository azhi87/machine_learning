production systems: or can we do better than bnf?.wsince the development of bnf, the definitionof the syntax of programming languages has been almost universally associated with context-free requirements. yet numerous interesting and difficult issues in syntax stem from the context-sensitive requirements,notably the compatibility between the declaration of an identifier and its uses, the correspondencebetween actual and formal parameters, and issues arising from block structure.  this paper exploresthe use of a formal notation called production systems in providing a readable and complete formal definitionof syntax.  as a practical illustration, a small but significant subset of pl/i is considered.  amore detailed presentation, as well as the application to define abstract syntax and translations between languages,is given in a previous paper by the author.cacm february, ledgard, h. f..ksyntax, translation, context-sensitive grammars,compilers, formal definition, pl/i standards.c. . .ca jb january ,   : pm
