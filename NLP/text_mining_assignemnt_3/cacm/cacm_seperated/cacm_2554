reduction of a band-symmetric generalized eigenvalue problem.wan algorithm is described for reducing thegeneralized eigenvalue problem ax = lambda bx to an ordinary problem, in case a and b are symmetric bandmatrices with b positive definite.  if n is the order of the matrix and m the bandwidth, the matricesa and b are partitioned into m-by-m blocks; and the algorithm is described in terms of these blocks. the algorithm reduces the generalized problem to an ordinary eigenvalue problem for a symmetric bandmatrix c whose bandwidth is the same as a and b.  the algorithm is similar to those of rutishauser andschwartz for the reduction of symmetric matrices to band form.  the calculation c requires order mn^operation.  the round-off error in the calculation of c is of the same order as the sum of the errors ateach of the n/m steps of the algorithm, the latter errors being largely determined by the condition of b with respect to inversion.cacm january, crawford, c. r..kgeneralized eigenvalues, symmetric band matrices.c.ca jb january ,   : pm
