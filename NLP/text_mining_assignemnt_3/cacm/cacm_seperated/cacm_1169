an algorithm for minimizing backboard wiring functions.wa partially exhaustive algorithm is presentedfor solving the following problem arising from automatic layout of a computer.  given an ordered sete, e,..., en of n computer components, for each permutation of the elements e, e.., en, there is attacheda value of an integer function f.  the algorithm finds a local minimum of f by evaluating the set {deltaf} of the increments corresponding to a certain set of exchanges of two elements.then the exchangecorresponding to the least negative increment of {delta f} is performed.  the process is iterated and stoppedwhen the set of the increments is a positive or empty set, which, it is proved, corresponds to aminimum.  the procedure is similar to the downhill method for finding the minimum of a real function f(p),and can be applied to other placement problems.  experimental results are presented with backboards formedby many elements and different initial placements.cacm november, pomentale, t.ca jb march ,   : pm
