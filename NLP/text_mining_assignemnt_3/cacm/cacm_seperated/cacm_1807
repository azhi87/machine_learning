optimization of expressions in fortran.wa method of optimizing the computation ofarithmetic and indexing expressions of a fortran program is presented.  the method is based on a linearanalysis of the definition points of the variables and the branching and do loop structure of the program. the objectives of the processing are () to eliminate redundant calculations when references aremade to common subexpression values, () to remove invariant calculations from do loops, () to efficientlycompute subscripts containing do iteration variables, and () to provide efficient index register usage.  themethod presented requires at least a three-pass compiler, the second of which is scanned backward.  ithas been used in the development of several fortran compilers that have proved to produce excellent objectcode without significantly reducing the compilation speed.cacm december, busam, v. a.england, d. e..kfortran, optimization, expressions, compilers,compilation, subscripts, register allocation, do loops, common subexpressions, invariant calculations.c.ca jb february ,   : pm
