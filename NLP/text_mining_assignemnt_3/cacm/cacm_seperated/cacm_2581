a locally-organized parser for spoken input.wthis paper describes lpars, a locally-organizedparsing system, designed for use in a continuous speech recognizer.  lpars processes a string of phonemeswhich contains ambiguity and error. the system is locally-organized in the sense that it builds localparse structures from reliable word candidates recognized anywhere in an input utterance.  these localstructures are used as "islands of reliability" to guide the search for more highly garbledwords which might complete the utterance.  cacm november, miller, p. l..kparsing, speech recognition, speech understanding,augmented transition network, local parsing.c. . .ca jb january ,   : am
