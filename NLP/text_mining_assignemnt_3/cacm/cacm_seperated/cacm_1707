generation of positive test matrices with known positive spectra.wsufficient conditions are given for a realmatrix to be similar to a positive matrix.  this result is used to construct a similarity transformationwhich, when applied to a particular upper triangular matrix, yields a positive matrix with a preassigned positive spectrum.cacm august, hall, c. a.porsching, t. a..ktest matrices, positive matrices, similaritytransformation, positive eigenvalues.c. .ca jb february ,   : am
