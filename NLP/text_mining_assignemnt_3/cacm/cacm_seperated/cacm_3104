test data as an aid in proving program correctness.wproofs of program correctness tend to be longand tedious, whereas testing, though useful in detecting errors, usually does not guarantee correctness. this paper introduces a techniques whereby test data can be used in proving program correctness. in addition to simplifying the process of proving correctness, this method simplifies the process of providingaccurate specification for a program.  the applicability of this technique to proceduresand recursive programs is demonstrated.cacm may, geller, m..kprogram verification, program testing, recursive programs.c. . .ca dh february ,   : pm
