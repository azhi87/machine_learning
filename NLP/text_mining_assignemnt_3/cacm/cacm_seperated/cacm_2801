storage-efficient representation of decimal data.wusually n decimal digits are represented byn bits in computers.  actually, two bcd digits can be compressed optimally and reversibly into  bits,and three digits into  bits, by a very simple algorithm based on the fixed-length combination of twovariable field-length encodings.  in over half of the cases the compressed code results from the conventionalbcd code by simple removal of redundant  bits.  a long decimal message can be subdivided intothree-digit blocks, and separately compressed; the result differs from the asymptotic minimum lengthby only . percent.  the hardware requirement is small, and the mappings can be done manually.cacm january, chi chen, t.ho, i. t..kbinary-coded decimal digits, decimal data storage.c. .ca jb january ,   : am
