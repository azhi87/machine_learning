the reconstruction of binary patterns from their projections.wgiven the horizontal and vertical projectionsof a finite binary pattern f, can we construct the original pattern f?  in this paper we give a characterizationof patterns that are reconstructable from their projection.  three algorithms are developedto reconstruct both unambiguous and ambiguous patterns.  it is shown that an unambiguous pattern canbe perfectly reconstructed in time m x n and that a pattern similar to an ambiguous pattern can also be constructedin time m x n, where m, n are the dimensions of the pattern frame.cacm january, chang, s..kpattern reconstruction, image reconstruction, datacompression, pattern recognition, integral geometry.c. .ca jb february ,   : pm
