automated printed circuit routing with a stepping aperture.wa computer program for routing interconnectionson a two-sided printed circuit board with a regular pattern of lines, pins (terminals), and vias(feed-through holes) is described.  in this program, each interconnection is given a planned routing-typically,down from the upper pin, through a via, and horizontally to the lower pin.  from the top, a virtualaperture (i.e. a long horizontal slit) is stepped down the board.  the planned routing is the basis forrerouting interconnections within the aperture to resolve conflicts for lines and vias below the apertureand to maximize the effective line usage.  if a conflict has not been resolved before the aperturearrives at the lower pin,interconnections are deleted to resolve the conflict.  extensions of this techniqueto the control of crosstalk between routed interconnections and to the problem of obtaining percent interconnect are also discussed.cacm may, lass, s.e..krouting, printed circuit, interconnections, aperture,stepping aperture, computer program, circuit board, lines, vias, pins.c. .ca jb february ,   : pm
