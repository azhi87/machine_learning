computer generation of gamma random variables.wa new method for generating random variablesfrom the gamma distribution with nonintegral shape parameter a is proposed.  this method is similar to twoother methods recently given by wallace and fishman.  it is compared with fishman's and ahrens and dieter's methods. the core storage requirements and programming effort for this method are similar to those of fishman'smethod.  the proposed method is the same as fishman's method for  < a <  and is faster than fishman'smethod for  < a < .  also, the proposed method is much simpler than ahrens and dieter's method and is faster for a < . cacm may, tadikamalla, p.r..kgamma variables, rejection method, computer methods.c. .ca dh february ,   : pm
