the automatic integration of ordinary differential equations.wan integration technique for the automaticsolution of an initial value problem for a set of ordinary differential equations is described.  a criterionfor the selection of the order of approximation is proposed.  the objective of the criterion is to increasethe step size so as to reduce solution time. an option permits the solution of "stiff" differentialequations.  a program embodying the techniques discussed appears in algorithm .cacm march, gear, c. w..kdifferential equations, stiff equations,integration, step control, order control.c.ca jb february ,   : pm
