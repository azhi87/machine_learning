an o(n) algorithm for determining a near-optimalcomputation order of matrix chain products.wthis paper discusses the computation of matrixchain products of the form m x m x ... x mn where mi's are matrices.  the order in which the matricesare computed affects the number of operations.  a sufficient condition about the association of thematrices in the optimal order is presented.  an o(n) algorithm to find an order of computation whichtakes less than  percent longer than the optimal time topt is also presented.  in most cases, the algorithmyields the optimal order or an order which takes only a few percent longer than topt (less than  percent on the average).cacm july, chin, f.y..kapproximate algorithm, heuristic algorithm,matrix multiplication, matrix chain product.c.ca dh february ,   : pm
