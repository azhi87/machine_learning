is "sometime" sometimes better than "always"? (intermittentassertions in proving program correctness).wthis paper explores a technique for proving thecorrectness and termination of programs simultaneously.  this approach, the intermittent-assertion method, involvesdocumenting the program with assertions that must be true at some time when control passes throughthe corresponding point, but that need not be true every time.  the method, introduced by burstall, promisesto provide a valuable complement to the more conventional methods.  the intermittent-assertion methodis presented with a number of examples of correctness and termination proofs.  some of these proofs are markedlysimpler than their conventional counterparts.  on the other hand, it is shown that a proof of correctnessor termination by any of the conventional techniques can be rephrased directly as a proof usingintermittent assertions.  finally, it is shown how the intermittent-assertion method can be appliedto prove the validity of program transformations and the correctness of continuously operating programs.cacm february, manna, z.waldinger, r..kintermittent assertions, correctness of programs,termination of programs, program verification, program transformation, continuously operating programs..c.ca jb march ,   : pm
