automast: automatic mathematical analysis and symbolic translation.wa procedure for numerically solving systemsof ordinary differential equation is shown to also generate symbolic solutions.  the procedure is basedon a finite taylor series expansion that includes an estimate of the error in the final result.  a computerprogram is described that reads in a system of such equations and then generates the expansionsfor all of the dependent variables. the expansions are determined symbolically, hence any non-numeric parametersin the original equations are carried automatically into the final expansions.  thus the exact influenceof any parameters on the problem solution can be easily displayed.cacm august, ball, w. e.berns, r. i.ca jb march ,   : pm
