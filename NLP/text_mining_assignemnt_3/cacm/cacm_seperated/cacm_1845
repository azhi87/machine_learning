loader standardization for overlay programs.wthe overlay capability is described for fourof the third generation computer systems: cdc-, ge-, ibm-, and univac-.  a critique of thefirst three systems is based on actual experience with a large overlaid trajectory simulation program;a short history and description of this program is presented.  a standardization of minimum capabilitiesfor loaders is recommended so that programs which must operate under more than one computer systemmay be easily converted and maintained.  a proposal that overlay software incorporates a memory occupationspecification concept instead of the conditional tree structure is delineated.  this concept providesmore efficient and cost-effective utilization of the memory as well as increased flexibility in program structure.cacm october, lanzano, b. c..kloader, overlay, partition, region, segmentation,linkage, linkage editor, standardization, memory utilization, memory occupation, tree structure,cdc-, ge-, ibm-, univac-.c. . . .ca jb february ,   : pm
