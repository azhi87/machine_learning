object code optimization.wmethods of analyzing the control flow and dataflow of programs during compilation are applied to transforming the program to improve object time efficiency. dominance relationships, indicating which statements are necessarily executed before others, areused to do global common expression elimination and loop identification.  implementation of these and otheroptimizations in os/ fortran h are described.cacm january, lowry, e. s.medlock, c. w..kcompilers, data flow analysis, dominance, efficiency,fortran,  graph theory, loop structure, machine instructions, object code, optimization, redundancyelimination, register assignment, system/.c. . .ca jb february ,   : pm
