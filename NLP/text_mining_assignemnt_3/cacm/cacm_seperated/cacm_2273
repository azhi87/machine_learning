conversion of decision tables by rule mask method without rule mask.wtwo algorithms for generating computer programsfrom decision tables are described.  the algorithms allow handling limited entry, extended entry, and mixedentry tables.  the algorithms are based on the rule mask method but need not have the masks at executiontime.  they perform the logical operations immediately rather than at the end of the interpretingprocess.  execution time can be considerably reduced by instantly marking rules which are not applicable (algorithms and ) or conditions which are already tested (algorithm ).  the new algorithms combine to acertain degree the advantages of mask methods with those of tree methods.cacm october, dathe, g..kdecision tables, rule mask, rule mask method,rule mask technique, program generator.c. . . .ca jb january ,   : pm
