cold-start vs. warm-start miss ratios.win a two-level computer storage hierarchy, missratio measurements are often made from a "cold start," that is made with the first-level  store initiallyempty.  for large capacities the effect on the measured miss ratio of the misses incurred whilefilling the first-level store can be significant, even for long reference strings.  use of "warm-start"rather than "cold-start" miss ratios cast doubt on the widespread belief that the observed "s-shape" oflifetime (reciprocal of miss ratio) versus capacity curve indicates a property of behavior of programs thatmaintain a constant number of pages in main storage.  on the other hand, if cold-start miss ratios are measuredas a function of capacity and measurement length, then they are useful in studying systems in whichoperation of a program is periodically interrupted by task switches.  it is shown how to obtain, under simpleassumptions, the cache miss ratio for multiprogramming from cold-start miss ratio values and how to obtainapproximate cold-start miss ratios from warm-start miss ratios.cacm october, easton, m.c.fagin, r..kmiss ratio, cold start, warm start, storage hierarchy,lifetime function, multiprogramming, s-shape.c. . .ca dh january ,   : pm
