new upper bounds for selection.wthe worst-case minimum number of comparisonscomplexity vi(n) of the i-th selection problem is considered.  a new upper bound for vi(n) improves thebound given by the standard hadian-sobel algorithm by a generalization of the kirkpatrick-hadian-sobelalgorithm, and extends kirkpatrick's method to a much wider range of application.  this generalizationcompares favorably with a recent algorithm by hyafil.cacm september, yap, c. k..kselection problem, algorithms, comparison problems,concrete computational complexity, upper bounds, worst-case analysis.c. .ca jb january ,   : am
