levels of language for portable software.wan increasing amount of software is beingimplemented in a portable form.  a popular way of accomplishing this is to encode the software in a speciallydesigned machine-independent language and then to map this language, often using a macro processor,into the assembly language of each desired object machine.  the design of the machine-independentlanguage is the key factor in this operation.  this paper discusses the relative merits of pitchingthis language at a high level or a low level, and presents some comparative results.cacm december, brown, p. j..kportable software, level of language, machineindependent, macro processor, efficiency.c. . .ca jb january ,   : am
