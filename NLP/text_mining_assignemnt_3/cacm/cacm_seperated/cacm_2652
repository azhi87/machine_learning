reduction of compilation costs through language contraction.wprogramming languages tailored to particulargroups of users can often be constructed by removingunwanted features from a general purpose language.  thispaper describes the use of simulation techniques to predict the savings in compilation cost achievableby such an approach.  the results suggest a function which describes the effect of changes in the power ofa language on the compilation cost of an algorithm expressed in that language: when features not actuallyused by the algorithm are removed from the language, the cost of compiling the algorithm decreases moderately,but when features that are needed are removed, the compilation cost increases sharply.cacm may, shaw, m..kdesign of programming languages, language contraction,compiler design, compilation cost, algol.c. .ca jb january ,   : pm
