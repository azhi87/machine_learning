a parser-generating system for constructing compressed compilers.wthis paper describes a parser-generating system(pgs) currently in use on the cdc- computer at purdue university.  the pgs is a fortran-coded compiler. in the input translation grammar, each bnf syntactic rule corresponds to a (possibly empty) "codegenerator" realizable as an assembly language, fortran or algol, subroutine that is called wheneverthat syntactic rule is applied in the parse of a program.  typical one-pass compilers constructed by thepgs translate source programs at speeds approaching , cards per minute.  for an xpl compiler, the parserprogram and its tables currently occupy  words of -bit core memory of which  words are parsingtable entries and  words are links to code generators.cacm november, mickunas, m. d.schneider, v. b..kparser generators, translator writing systems,syntactic analysis, normal-form grammars, pushdown automata, translation grammars, translator optimization, compression algorithm.c. . .ca jb january , : am
