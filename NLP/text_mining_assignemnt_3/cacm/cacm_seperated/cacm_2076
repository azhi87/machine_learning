cubic splines on uniform meshes.wa very simple procedure is presented for constructing cubic splines,periodic or nonperiodic, on uniform meshes.  arcs of two cubics sufficeto construct a basis of cardinal splines.  an algorithm is given which requires only minimal storage and computation and permits easy trade-off of one against the other.cacm april, nilson, e. n..ksimple spline representation, cardinal splines, uniform mesh splines.c.ca jb february ,   : pm
