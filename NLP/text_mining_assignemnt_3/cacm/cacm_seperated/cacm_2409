an algorithm for the approximate solutionof wiener-hopf integral equations.wan explicit approximate solution is given foran equation.  where it is assumed that the classical wiener-hopf technique may be applied.  it is furthermoreassumed that fourier transforms are known explicitly.  the approximate solution depends on two positive parameters.cacm november, stenger, f..kintegral equations, wiener-hopf, convolution, approximate solution.c.ca jb january ,   : pm
