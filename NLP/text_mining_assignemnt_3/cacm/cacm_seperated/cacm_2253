index ranges for matrix calculi.wthe paper describes a scheme for symbolicmanipulation of index expressions which arise as a by-product of the symbolic manipulation of expressionsin the matrix calculi described by the authors in a previous paper.  this scheme attempts program optimizationby transforming the original algorithm rather than the machine code.  the goal is to automaticallygenerate code for handling the tedious address calculations necessitated by complicated data structures. the paper is therefore preoccupied with "indexing by position."  the relationship of "indexing byname" and "indexing by position" is discussed.cacm december, bayer, r.witzgall, c..kaddress calculations, algorithm transformation,compilation, data structures, indexing by name, indexing by position, index domain, index map, indexrange, matrix expressions, normal form, programming languages, program optimization, range operations, symbolicmanipulation, syntactic analysis, well-formed expressions.c. . .ca jb january ,   : pm
