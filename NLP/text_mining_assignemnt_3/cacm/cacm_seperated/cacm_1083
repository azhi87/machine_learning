an experiment in a user-oriented computer system.wa version of a software-hardware system forthe purpose of facilitating the programming and analysis of well-formulated problems is described.  a modifiedflexowriter is used to generate computer-acceptable input when equations or computable requests are typedin much the same manner as they would appear in conventional mathematical texts.  the typing and languagerules are quite flexible and unrestrictive.  while the compiler part is efficient, the system asa whole has much broader aspects as a tool for the study of problem solving and self-teaching systems.cacm may, klerer, m.may, j.ca jb march ,   : am
