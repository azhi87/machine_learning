complex matrix inversion versus real.wa comparison of complex matrix with real matrix inversionis made.  it is shown that the complex inversion can be up to twice as fast as the real inversion.  further, the rounding errorbound for complex inversion is about one-eighth that of real,for gaussian elimination.  using extended inner productaccumulation the bound is half of the real system.cacm september, ehrlich, l. w..kcomplex matrix inversion, matrix inversion, inversion, rounding errors,rounding error bound, error bounds, complex rounding error bounds.c. . .ca jb february ,   : am
