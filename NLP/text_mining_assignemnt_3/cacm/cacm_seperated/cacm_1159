machine independence: its technology and economics.wa survey is offered of techniques for transferringprograms, and especially compilers, from one computer to another.  of the methods examined, the"bootstrap" technique is singled out for detailed discussion, with emphasis on its economics. the considerationsthat determine the applicability of bootstrapping in any specific case are discussed, and an attemptis made to assign appropriate qualitative weights to them.  finally, reasons are given for believing that themachine-independence problem is being substantially diminished by current trends in computer design, andthat it is this process of convergence in hardware design rather than any foreseeable software developmentsthat will lead to its satisfactory resolution.cacm december, halpern, m. i.ca jb march ,   : pm
