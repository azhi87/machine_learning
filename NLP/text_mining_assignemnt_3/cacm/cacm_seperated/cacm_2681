dynamic memory repacking.wa probabilistic model of a multiprogramming systemis exercised in order to determine the conditions under which the dynamic repacking of main memory is beneficial. an expression is derived for the maximum interference that a repacking process may introducebefore the original performance of the system is degraded.  alternative approaches to repacking are discussed,and the operating conditions that lead to improved system throughput through repacking are delineated.cacm march, balkovich, e.chiu, w.presser, l.wood, r..kdynamic memory repacking, memory compaction,storagefragmentation, multiprogramming system model, probabilistic model, central processor productivity,resource utilization, system throughput.c. . .ca jb january ,   : pm
