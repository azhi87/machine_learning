optimizing decision trees through heuristically guided search.woptimal decision table conversion has beentackled in the literature using two approaches, dynamic programming and branch-and-bound.  the formertechnique is quite effective, but its time and space requirements are independent of how "easy" thegiven table is.  furthermore, it cannot be used to produce good, quasi optimal solutions.  the branch-and-boundtechnique uses a good heuristic to direct the search, but is cluttered up by an enormous searchspace, since the number of solutions increases with the number of test variables according to a double exponential.  in this paper we suggest a heuristically guided top-down search algorithm which, like dynamicprogramming, recognizes identical subproblems but which can be used to find both optimal and quasi optimalsolutions.  the heuristic search method introduced in this paper combines the positive aspects of the abovetwo techniques.  compressed tables with a large number of variables can be handled without deriving expanded tables first. cacm december, martelli, a.montanari, u..kdecision table, optimal decision table conversion,decision tree, heuristic search, and/or graphs, dynamic programming, branch-and-bound.c. . . .ca dh january ,   : pm
