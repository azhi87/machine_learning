exclusive simulation of activity in digital networks.wa technique for simulating the detailed logicnetworks of large and active digital systems is described.  essential objectives sought are improvedease and economy in model generation, economy in execution time and space, and a facility for handlingsimultaneous activities.  the main results obtained are a clear and useful separation of structural and behavioralmodel description, a reduction of manual tasks in converting boolean logic into a structural model,the elimination of manual processes in achieving exclusive simulation of activity, an event-schedulingtechnique which does not deteriorate in economyas the event queue grows in length, and a simulationprocedure which deals effectively with any mixture of serial and simultaneous activities.  the passage oftime is simulated in a precise, quantitative fashion and systems to be simulated may be combinations of synchronousand asynchronous logic.  certain aspects of the techniques described may be used for the simulationof network structures other than digital networks.cacm february, ulrich, e. g..ksimulation, logical simulation, digital simulation,large systems simulation, network structures, scheduling, queuing, simultaneous activities, parallel events.c. . .ca jb february ,   : am
