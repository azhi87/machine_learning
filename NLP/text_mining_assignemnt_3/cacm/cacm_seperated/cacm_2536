telecommunications using a front-end minicomputer.wthe use of a front-end minicomputer to providevaried remote terminal access to a large scale computer is considered.  the problems of embeddingtelecommunications i/o within an operating system are discussed, and it is shown how the decentralizationof intelligence acquired by front-end processing vastly simplifies the problem.  a specific implementation isdiscussed with emphasis on the main processor-minicomputer link, the hardware-software implementation, the effectof the main processor operating system, and an assessment of the advantages over a hard wired line controller.cacm march, feinroth, y.franceschini, e.goldstein, m..ktelecommunications, minicomputer, front-endprocessor, remote job entry, remote terminals.c. . .ca jb january ,   : am
