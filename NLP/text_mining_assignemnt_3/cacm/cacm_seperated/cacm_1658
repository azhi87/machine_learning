analysis of algorithms for the zero-one programming problem.wthis paper is concerned with a review and examinationof several existing algorithms for the zero-one programming problem.  computational experienceis summarized.  the machine time and storage requirements of several of the algorithms are comparedover several test problems of small and intermediate size.  computer experiments still provide little hopeof solving problems with over  variables with a reasonable amount of machine time.cacm december, gue, r. l.liggett, j. c.cain, k. c..koperations research, optimization theory, integerprogramming, zero-one variables, algorithms.c. .ca jb february ,   : pm
