generating discrete random variables in a computer.wthis note is concerned with details of how toinstruct a computer to choose one from many things with assigned probabilities.  the method uses a uniformvariable to direct the computer to a memory location; if this is done by a sequence of appropriately chosenconditional probabilities, efficient use of memory space and quite fast programs will result.cacm january, marsaglia, g.ca jb march ,   : pm
