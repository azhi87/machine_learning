   a formac program for the solution of linear boundary and initial value problems.w  a computer program is described which has been developed for obtainingapproximate solutions to linear initial and boundary-value problems involving differential equations. for each problem, input to the program includes:   . the equations (in symbolic form) to be satisfied  -  the differentialequations, equations describing auxiliary conditions such as boundary conditions, etc.   . a numerical description of the regions in which each of the equationsare to be satisfied.   . sets of functions (in symbolic form) to be used in linear combinationsto approximate the solution functions. give the above input, the programgenerates an approximation to the solutions of the specified problemm in terms of the specified functions which is optimum in the least-squares sense.cacm august, cuthill, e.ca es march ,  : am
