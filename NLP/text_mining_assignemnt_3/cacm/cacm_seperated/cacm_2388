optimizing binary trees grown with a sorting algorithm.witems can be retrieved from binary trees grownwith a form of the algorithm quicksort in an average time proportional to log n, where n is the numberof items in the tree.  the binary trees grown by this algorithm sometimes have some branches longerthan others; therefore, it is possible to reduce the average retrieval time by restructuring the tree tomake the branches as uniform in length as possible.  an algorithm to do this is presented.  the use of thisalgorithm is discussed, and it is compared with another which restructures the tree after each new item is added.cacm february, martin, w. a.ness, d. n..kretrieving information from binary trees, globaland local optimization, sorting, recursion.c. .ca jb january ,   : pm
