conversion of limited-entry decision tables to computer programs.wdecision tables are useful for describing aset of complex decision rules based on given sets of conditions.  algorithms that can efficiently convertthe tables into computer programs will extend the usefulness of decision tables to computer users. two such algorithms, based on work done by m. s. montalbano, are described and extended here to handledashes and else-decision rules.  the first algorithm minimizes the computer storage space required for theresultant program, the second minimizes computer running time. during the conversion process, both pinpointany contradictions or redundancies among the rules in a table.cacm november, pollack, s. l.ca jb march ,   : pm
