a statistical model for console behavior in multiuser computers.wthe ability of a computer system to communicatewith the outside world efficiently is as important as its ability to perform computations efficiently. it is quite difficult to characterize a particular user, but rather easy to characterize the entire user community. based on the properties of this community we have postulated a hypothetical "virtual console." no claim is made that a virtual console behaves like any actual console, but the entire collection ofvirtual consoles models the collection of actual consoles.  using the model we answer questions like: how many processes are suspended waiting for console input?  what is the maximum rate at which a process canexecute?  what bounds can be set on overall buffer requirements?  answers to these and similar questionsare needed in certain aspects of operating system design.cacm september, denning, p. j..kstatistical models for input-output, operatingsystem design, input-output design.c. . .ca jb february ,   : am
