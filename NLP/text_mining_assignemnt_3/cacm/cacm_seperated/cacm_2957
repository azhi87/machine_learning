database abstractions: aggregation.waggregation is in troduced as an abstractionwhich is important in conceptualizing the real world.  aggregation transforms a relationship betweenobjects into a higher-level object.  a new data type, called aggregation, is developed which, undercertain criteria of "well-definedness," specifies aggregation abstractions.  relational databases definedas collections of aggregates are structured as a hierarchy on n-ary relations.  to main tain well-definedness,update operations on such databases must preserve two invariants.  well-defined relations aredistinct from relations in third normal form.  it is shown that these notions are complementary and both areimportant in database design.  a top-down methodology for database design is described which separatesdecisions concerning aggregate structure from decisions concerning key identification.  it issuggested that aggregate types, and other types which support real-world abstractions without in troducingimplementation detail, should be incorporated into programming languages.cacm june, smith, j. m.smith, d. c. p..kdata abstraction, relational database, data type,aggregation, database design, data structure, knowledge representation, data definition language.c. . . . . .ca jb december ,   : am
