top-to-bottom parsing rehabilitated?.wthis note is concerned with the efficiencyof the top-to-bottom parsing algorithm as used in connection with programming language grammars.  it isshown, for instance, that retracing of unprofitable paths can often be eliminated by a suitable rearrangementof the productions defining the grammar.  the essential weakness of the method is in dealing with complicatedsyntactic structures which are in practice only sparsely occupied, e.g., arithmetic expressions.cacm april, brooker, r. a.ca jb february ,   : am
