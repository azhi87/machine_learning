optimal his togram matching by monotone gray level transformation.wthis paper investigates the problem of optimalhis togram matching using monotone gray level transformation, which always assigns all picture pointsof a given gray level i to another gray level t(i) such that if i > j, then t(i) > t(j).  the objectiveis to find a transformed digital picture of a given picture such that the sum of absolute errorsbetween the gray level his togram of the transformed picture and that of a reference picture is minimized. this is equivalent to placing k linearly ordered objects of different sized one by one into k linearly orderedboxes of assorted sizes, such that the accumulated error of space under packed or overpackedin the boxes is minimized; the placement function is monotonic, which ensures a polynomial time solutionto this problem.  a tree search algorithm for optimal his togram matching is presented which has timecomplexity o(k x k).  if the monotone property is dropped, then the problem becomes np-complete,even if it is restricted to k = . cacm october, chang, s.k.wong, y.w..koptimal his togram matching, gray level transformation,packing problem, tree searching algorithm, picture processing.c. . .ca dh january ,   : pm
