generating beta variates with nonintegrel shape parameters.wa new rejection method is described for generatingbeta variates.  the method is compared with previously published methods both theoretically and throughcomputer timings.  it is suggested that the method has advantages in both speed and programmingsimplicity over previous methods, especially for "difficult" combinations of parameter values.cacm april, cheng, r.c.h..kbeta variates, random numbers, simulation.c. .ca dh february ,   : pm
