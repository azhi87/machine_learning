a general formulation of storage allocation.wformalization of a general computer storageallocation process is attempted.  with a given computer m is associated a fictitious computer m' essentiallyidentical to m except in respect to possession of unbounded primary storage.  mappings of the totalstorage set (internal and external) of m into the direct address set of m' are introduced.  a programsequence p for m' is termed m-admissible (relative to a specific execution time period) if there is a mappingunderwhich p and its effective data referents are all located in the direct address set of m.  storageallocation is considered as a process of establishing for an arbitrary m' program  a sequence of mappings, a decouplingof the program into m-admissible subprograms and a linking set of interludes.  an existence proofin terms of a completely interpretive m program as indicated.  some special cases are discussed.  variousrestrictions on generality of m' programs are considered under which more practical realizationof allocation processes becomes tractable.cacm october, roberts jr., a. e.ca jb march ,   : pm
