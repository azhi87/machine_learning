optimizing bit-time computer simulation.wa major component of a bit-time computer simulationprogram is the boolean compiler.  the compiler accepts the boolean functions representing the simulated computer'sdigital circuits, and generates corresponding sets of machine instructions which are subsequentlyexecuted on the "host" computer.  techniques are discussed for increasing the sophistication of the booleancompiler so as to optimize bit-time computer simulation.  the techniques are applicable to any general-purpose computer.cacm november, katz,j. h.ca jb march ,   : pm
