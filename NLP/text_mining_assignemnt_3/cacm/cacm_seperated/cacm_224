sequential formula translation.wthe syntax of an algorithmic language suchas algol is conveniently described as a sequence of states indicated by an element called cellar.  transitionsare controlled by admissible state-symbol pairs which may be represented by a transition matrix.this description of syntax furnishes at the same time an extremely simple rule for translating into machineprograms statements in the algorithmic language.  sequential treatment, however, is not feasible in the caseof certain optimizing processes such as recursive address calculation.cacm february, samelson, k.bauer, f. l.ca jb march ,   : pm
