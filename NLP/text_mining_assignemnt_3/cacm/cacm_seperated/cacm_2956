some ideas on data types in high-level languages.wa number of issues are explored concerning thenotion that a data type is a set of values together with a set of primitive operations on those values.  amongthese are the need for a notation for iterating over the elements of any finite set (instead of themore narrow for i:=  to n notation), the use of the domain of an array as a data type, the need fora simple notation for allowing types of parameters to be themselves parameters (but in a restrictive fashion),and resulting problems with conversion of values from one type to another.cacm june, gries, d.gehani, n..kdata types, generic procedures, programming languages.c. . .ca jb december ,   : pm
