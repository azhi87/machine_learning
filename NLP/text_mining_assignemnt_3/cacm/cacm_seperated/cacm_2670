efficient implementation of a variable projectionalgorithm for nonlinear least squares problems.wnonlinear least squares frequently arise for whichthe variables to be solved for can be separated into a linear and a nonlinear part.  a variable projectionalgorithm has been developed recently which is designed to take advantage of the structure of a problemwhose variables separate in this way.  this paper gives a slightly more efficient and slightly moregeneral version of this algorithm than has appeared earlier.cacm march, krogh, f. t..knonlinear least squares, parameter estimation, variable projection.c. .ca jb january ,   : am
