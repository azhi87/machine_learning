experimental evaluation of informationretrieval through a teletypewriter.wexperiments designed to evaluate the capabilitiesof mechanized information retrieval systems, with emphasis on interactive (man-machine) language and onsome of the mechanical and psychological limitations in their design, were conducted at the moore school informationsystems laboratory.  the basic assumption of the research is that an information retrieval systemthat provides for man-machine dialogue at a remote inquiry terminal should provide a searcher with manyof the tools which would be available to him were he actually performing his search at a library or repositoryof documents.  factors involved in evaluation of such a system include ease of use, learning time, andeffectiveness of actual retrieval.  three experiments and the conclusions resulting from them are detailed.cacm september, rubinoff, m.bergman, s.franks, w.rubinoff, e.r..kinformation retrieval testing,  information systemevaluation, experimental document retrieval, document retrieval, document perusal, man-machine communication,remote console communication, teletypewriter communication, remote terminal communication, retrievalcommand language, symbolic command language, interactive systems, user learning factors, on-line searching.c. . . .ca jb february ,   : am
