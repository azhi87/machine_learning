relaxation methods for image reconstruction.wthe problem of recovering an image (a functionof two variables) from experimentally available integrals of its grayness over thin strips is of greatimportance in a large number of scientific areas.  an important version of the problem in medicine isthat of obtaining the exact density distribution within the human body from x-ray projections.one approachthat has been taken to solve this problem consists of translating the available information intoa system of linear inequalities.  the size and the sparsity of the resulting system (typically, ,inequalities with fewer than  percent of the coefficients nonzero) makes methods using successiverelaxations computationally attractive, as compared to other ways of solving systems of inequalities. in this paper, it is shown that, for a consistent system of linear inequalities, any sequence of relaxarion parameterslying strictly between  and  generates a sequence of vectors which converges to a solution. under the same assumptions, for a system of linear equations, the relaxation method converges to the minimumnorm solution.  previously proposed techniquesare shown to be special cases of our procedure withdifferent choices of relaxation parameters.  the practical consequences for image reconstruction of thechoice of the relaxation parameters are discussed.cacm february, herman, g.t.lent, a.lutz, p.h..kbiomedical image processing, image reconstruction,x-ray tomography, mathematical programming, linear inequalities, relaxation techniques.c. . . . . . .ca jb march ,   : pm
