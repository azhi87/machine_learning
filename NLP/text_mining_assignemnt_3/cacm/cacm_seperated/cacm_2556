adaptive correction of program statements.wa method of analyzing statements in a programminglanguage which can tolerate a considerable inaccuracy in their specification is proposed. this methodinvolves principles at present mainly confined to studies in the area of artificial intelligence suchas feature extraction, approximate tree matching, and strategy improvement by feedback from the matching process. a pilot program incorporating the principles is described and preliminary operating results are presented. a final section surveys further principles which are currently being investigated.cacm january, james, e. b.partridge, d. p..kadaptive, linguistic pattern matching, automaticparsing, approximate match, compiler, program statement analysis, syntax analysis.c. . .ca jb january ,   : pm
