storage organization in programming systems.wthe system of program and data representationthat has been in use on the rice university computer for five years is described.  each logical entity in storageoccupies a block of consecutive memory locations.  each block is labeled by a codeword and may containa program, a data vector, or codewords which in turn label blocks to form arrays.  this storage arrangementis discussed with its realized advantages or programming systems: simplicity of programmed addressing,flexibility of data structures, efficiency of memory utilization, variability of system compositionduring execution, means of linkage between programs and from programs to data, and basis for storage protection. the application of labeled blocks may be extended to areas of time-sharing and multimedia storagecontrol.  on the basis of experience at rice, some ideas on such extensions are presented.cacm november, jodeit, j. g..kstorage allocation, storage organization, storagecontrol, codewords, data representation, program representation, data structures, storage protection,addressing mechanisms, paging, segmentation, file handling.c. . .ca jb february ,   : pm
