integer and signed constants in algol.wa few remarks are given on the relations betweensyntax and semantics in the programming languages.  the aim is to point out that, if it is true that the grammarof a context-free language should be conceived not only as a strings-generating device but also as amethod for expressing a meaning, then the grammar of algol is open to some criticism.cacm december, petrone, l.vandoni, c. e.ca jb march ,   : pm
