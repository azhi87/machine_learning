a learning program which plays partnership dominoes.wa learning program has been written is basicto play four-player partnership dominoes.  because dominoes is a game of incomplete information, the programuses somewhat different principles of artificial intelligence from those used in programs for gamesof complete information, such as checkers, chess, and go.  the program was constructed to use a "strategysignature table" which classifies board situations through the interactions of game parameters. each entryin the table contains adaptively determined weights indicating the advi sability of various strategies. once chosen, a strategy then employs probability analysis and linear polynomial evaluation to choosea move.  our program wins approximately two-thirds of its games in tournament situations, and has defeated championship players.cacm august, smith, m. h..kartificial intelligence, intelligence learning,heuristic procedures, heuristic programming, game playing, problem solving,dominoes, incomplete information,machine learning, signature table, learning programs, strategy learning.c. . . .ca jb january ,   : am
