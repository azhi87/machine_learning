intentional resolution of privacy protection in database systems.wtraditionally, privacy protection in databasesystems is understood to be the control over what information a given user can get from a database. this paper is concerned with another, independent, dimension of privacy protection, the control over whata user is allowed to do with a piece of information supplied to him by the database.  the ability to conditionthe supply of information on its intended use is called here "intentional resolution" of privacyprotection.  the practical importance of intentional resolution is demonstrated by several examples, and its realizationis discussed.  it is shown that intentional resolution can be achieved, but that it involves a radicalchange from the traditional approach to the process of user-database interaction.  in particular,it appears to be necessary for the database to impose a certain amount of control over the internalbehavior of users' programs which interact with it.  a model for user-database interactionwhich admits such a control is developed.cacm march, minsky, n..kprotection in database, protection in programminglanguages, privacy, security, intentional resolution of privacy, interaction with databases.c. . . .ca jb january ,   : pm
