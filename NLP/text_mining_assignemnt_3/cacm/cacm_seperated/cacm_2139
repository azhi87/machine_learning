implementation of the substring test by hashing.wa technique is described for implementing thetest which determines if one string is a substring of another.  when there is low probability that the testwill be satisfied, it is shown how the operation can be speeded up considerably if it is preceded bya test on appropriately chosen hash codes of the strings.cacm december, harrison, m. c..ksubstring, hashing, subset, signature, informationcompression, information retrieval, searching.c. . .ca jb february ,   : am
