further evidence for the analysis of algorithmsfor the zero-one programming problem.wthe purpose of this note is to report computationalexperience additional to that recently summarized by gue et al, with two algorithms for thezero-one linear programming problem.  an error in gue's paper is corrected.  the utility of one ofthe algorithms as a suboptimizer is indicated.cacm january, proll, l. g..koperations research, integer programming, zero-one variables, algorithms.c. .ca jb february ,   : am
