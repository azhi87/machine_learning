computer experiments in finite algebra.wa medium-scale programming system is writtenin mad and fap on the ibm  to manipulate some of the objects of modern algebra: finite groups, mapsand sets of maps, subsets and sets of subsets, constant integers and truth-values.  designed to operatein a time-sharing environment, the system can serve as a teacher's aid to the undergraduate student ofmodern algebra, as well as for the working scientist or engineer wishing to familiarize himself with the subset.cacm august, maurer, w. d.ca jb march ,   : pm
