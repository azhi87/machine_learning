interval arithmetic determinant evaluationand its use in testing for a chebyshev system.wtwo recent papers, one by hansen and one byhansen and r. r. smith, have shown how interval arithmetic (i.a.) can be used effectively to bound errorsin matrix computations.  in the present paper a method proposed by hasen and r. r. smith is comparedwith straightforward use of i.a. in determinant evaluation.  computational results show the accuracyand running times that can be expected when using i.a. for determinant evaluation.  an application usingi.a. determinants in a program to test a set of functions to see if they form a chebyshev system is then presented.cacm february, smith, l. b..kinterval arithmetic, range arithmetic, error bounds,determinant evaluation, chebyshev system, mathematical proof by computer.c. . .ca jb february ,   : am
