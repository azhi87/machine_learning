code structures for protection and manipulation of variable-length items.wwhen items are made up of a variable numberof characters, each containing the same number of bits, certain control information (partition symbols)is inserted to mark their separations.  since errors in identification of these control characterscan lead to serious trouble, methods of protecting these symbols are indicated.  a -bit code assignmentof alphanumeric characters for fixed word-length computers is given and its suitability for error detectionand variable-length item manipulation is shown.  also indicated is its flexibility during certain arithmetic operations.cacm january, ramamoorthy, c. v.ca jb march ,   : pm
