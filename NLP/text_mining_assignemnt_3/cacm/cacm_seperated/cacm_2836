weighted derivation trees.wthe nodes of a weighted derivation tree are associatedwith weighting functions over the vocabulary of a context-free grammar.  an algorithm is presentedfor constructing the optimal derivation tree having the same structure as a given weighted derivation tree. in addition, the correctness of the algorithm is established.  the method may be applied to problemsinvolving probabilistic parsing or combinatorial optimization.cacm september, loui, m. c..kderivation tree, parse tree, probabilistic grammar,structural ambiguity, combinatorial optimization.c. .ca jb january ,   : am
