fix point approach to the theory of computation .wfollowing the fix point theory of scott, thesemantics of computer programs are defined in terms of the least fix points of recursive programs.  thisallows not only the justification of all existing verification techniques, but also their extension to thehandling, in a uniform manner of various properties of computer programs, including correctness, termination, and equivalence.cacm july, manna, z.vuillemin, j..kverification techniques, semantics of programminglanguages, least fix points, recursive programs, computational induction.c. .ca jb january ,   : pm
