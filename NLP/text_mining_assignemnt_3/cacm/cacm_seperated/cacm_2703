the intrinsically exponential complexity ofthe circularity problem for attribute grammars.wattribute grammars are an extension of context-freegrammars devised by knuth as a mechanism for including the semantics of a context-free languagewith the syntax of the language.  the circularity problem for a grammar is to determine whether the semanticsfor all possible sentences (programs) in fact will be well defined.  it is proved that this problemis, in general, computationally intractable.  specifically, it is shown that any deterministic algorithmwhich solves the problem must for infinitely many cases use an exponential amount of time.an improvedversion of knuth's circularity testing algorithm is also given, which actually solves the problem within exponential time.cacm december, jazayeri, m.ogden, w. f.rounds, w. c..kattribute grammars, circularity problem, context-freegrammars, computational complexity, exponential time, semantics.c. .ca jb january ,  : pm
