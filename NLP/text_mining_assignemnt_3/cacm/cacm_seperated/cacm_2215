application of game tree searching techniquesto sequential pattern recognition.wa sequential pattern recognition (spr) proceduredoes not test all the features of a pattern at once.  instead, it selects a feature to be tested.  afterreceiving the result of that test, the procedure either classifies the unknown pattern or selects anotherfeature to be tested, etc.  medical diagnosis is an example of spr.  in this paper the authors suggestthat spr be viewed as a one-person game played against nature (chance).  virtually all the powerful techniquesdeveloped for searching two-person, strictly competitive game trees can easily be incorporated eitherdirectly or by analogy into spr procedures.  in particular, one can incorporate the "mini averagebacking-up procedure" and the "gamma procedure," which are the analogues of the "minimax backing-up procedure"and the "alpha-beta procedure," respectively.  some computer simulated experiments in character recognitionare presented.  the results indicate that the approach is promising.cacm february, slagle, j. r.lee, r. c. t..ksequential pattern recognition, game tree searching,game against nature, gamma procedure, mini average backing-up procedure, dynamic programming, branch-and-boundapproach, optimal solution.c. . .ca jb february ,   : am
