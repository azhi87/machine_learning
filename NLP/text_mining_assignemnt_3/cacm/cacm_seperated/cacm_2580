a method for composing simple traditional music by computer.wa method is described for composing musicalrounds by computer.  this method uses some music theory plus additional heuristics.  fundamental to themethod is a set of productions together with sets of applicability rules and weight rules which operateon the productions deciding when and to what extent they are available for use.  several rounds generatedby the computer implementation of the method are presented.  generally, the resultant music sounds mediocreto the professional although usually pleasing to the layman.  it appears that full-blown music theoryis not needed for rounds--all the hardware required for structural levels is not necessary for these pieces. the author has tried to address both musicians and computer scientists.cacm november, rader, g. m..kartificial intelligence, heuristic programming,models of cognitive processes, computer music, computer composition, music theory, formal languages, probabilistic grammars.c. . .ca jb january ,   : am
