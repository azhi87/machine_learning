an interactive command generating facility.wa facility to permit conversationally controlled tasksto be executed in a noninteractive environment is proposed.a means by which programs can generate interactive time-sharing commandsand receive the corresponding output response is presented.  the commands will be invoked as if they had been typed at a console keyboard.  it is argued that this facility will help overcome some of the current limitations in man-computer communication. a set of functions to accomplish the above which could be embedded into any string processing language is suggested, and necessary information pertinent to implementation of the facility on existing time-sharing systems is given.cacm july, grant, c. a..ktime-sharing, command languages, pseudo-teletype, interaction,conditional job control, operating systems.c. . . .ca jb february ,   : am
