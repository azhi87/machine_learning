normalization techniques for hand printed numerals.wfamily of pattern standardizationtechniques based on geometrical projection is applied to a file ofdigitized hand printed numerals obtained from sales clerks. theprinciple involves transforming a quadrilateral specified in termsof the convex hull of each pattern into a square. the amount ofoverlap within each class of characters versus the amount between classesis used to evaluate the degree of normalization achieved with respect to other published methods including size and shear normalization through moments.cacm august, nagy, g.tuong, n..kpattern recognition, character recognition, normalization,projective transformation, central projection, handprinted characters, handwriting, linear transformation,size normalization, mapping, pattern preprocessor.c. .ca jb february ,   : pm
