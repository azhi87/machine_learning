on the automatic simplification of source-language programs.wmethods of simplification that can be appliedautomatically to programs written in an algol-like language are discussed.  the simplifications are basedon the form of the program and the knowledge obtained by a processor, without any understanding of what theprogram is supposed to do.  these methods have been implemented in a processor called sure that acceptsa program written in jovial and outputs an equivalent jovial program that may be shorter and may be executedfaster than the original.  sure is described, some of the problems encountered in automatic improvementat the source-language level are discussed, and further types of automatic program improvement are suggested.cacm march, clark, e. r.ca jb february ,   : pm
