use of tree structures for processing files.win data processing problems, files are frequentlyused which must both be searched and altered.  binary search techniques are efficient for searchinglarge files, but the associated file organization is not readily adapted to the file alterations.  conversely,a chained file allocation permits efficient alteration but cannot be searched efficiently. a fileorganized into a tree-like structure is discussed, and it is shown that such a file may both be searchedand altered with times proportional to slog(s)n, where n is the number of file items and s is a parameterof the tree.  it is also shown that optimizing the value of s leads to a search time which is only per cent slower than the binary search.  the tree organization employs two data chains and may be consideredto be a compromise between the organizations for the binary search and the chained file.  the relationof the tree organization to multidimensional indexing and to the trie structure is also discussed.cacm may, sussenguth jr., e. h.ca jb march ,   : am
