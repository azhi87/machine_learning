capability-based addressing.wvarious addressing schemes making use of segmenttables are examined.  the inadequacies of these schemes when dealing with shared addresses areexplained. these inadequacies are traced to the lack of an efficient absolute address for objects inthese systems.  the direct use of a capability as an address is shown to overcome these difficultiesbecause it provides the needed absolute address.  implementation of capability-based addressing is discussed. it is predicted that the use of tags to identify capabilities will dominate.  a hardware addresstranslation scheme which never requires the modification of the representation of capabilities issuggested. the scheme uses a main memory hash table for obtaining a segment's location in main memory givenits unique code.  the hash table is avoided forrecently accessed segments by means of a set of associativeregisters.  a computer using capability-based addressing may be substantially superior to presentsystems on the basis of protection, simplicity of programming conventions, and efficient implementation.cacm july, fabry, r. s..kaddressing, capabilities, addressing hardware,protection, protection hardware, shared addresses, information sharing, operating systems, computerutility, segmentation, tagged architecture.c. . . .ca jb january ,   : pm
