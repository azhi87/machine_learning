interference in multiprocessor computer systems with interleaved memory.wthis paper analyzes the memory interferencecaused by several processors simultaneously using several memory modules.  exect results are computed fora simple model of such a system.   the limiting value is derived for the relative degree of memory interferenceas the system size increases.  the model of the limiting behavior of the system yields approximateresults for the simple model and also suggests that the results are valid for a much larger class of models,including those more nearly like real systems that the simple model are tested against some measurementsof program behavior and simulations of systems using memory references from real programs.  the modelresults provide a good indication of the performance that should be expected from real system of this type.cacm june, baskett, f.smith, a. j..kmemory, memory interference, multiprocessing,interleaved memory, trace driven simulation.c. . . .ca jb january ,   : pm
