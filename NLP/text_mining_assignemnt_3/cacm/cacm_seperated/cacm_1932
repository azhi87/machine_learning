the logarithmic error and newton's method for the square root.wthe problem of obtaining optimal starting valuesfor the calculation of the square root using newton's method is considered.  it has been pointed outelsewhere that if relative error is used as the measure of goodness of fit, optimal results are notobtained when the initial approximation is a best fit.  it is shown here that if, instead, the so-calledlogarithmic error is used, then a best initial fit is optimal for both types of error.  moreover, useof the logarithmic error appears to simplify the problem of determining the optimal initial approximation.cacm february, king, r. f.phillips, d. l..ksquare root, newton's method, relative error, logarithmicerror, best fit, optimal approximation, maximal error, recurrence relation, integer root, error curve.c. .ca jb february ,   : am
