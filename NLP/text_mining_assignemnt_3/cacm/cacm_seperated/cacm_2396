muse: a model to understand simple english.wmuse is a computer model for natural languageprocessing, based on a semantic memory network like that of quillian's tlc.  muse, from a model to understandsimple english, processes english sentences of unrestricted content but somewhat restricted format. the model first applies syntactic analysis to eliminate some interpretations and then employs a simplifiedsemantic intersection procedure to find a valid interpretation of the input.  while the semanticprocessing is similar to tlc's, the syntactic component includes the early use of parse trees and specialpurpose rules.  the "relational triple" notation used during interpretation of input is compatible with muse'smemory structures, allowing direct verification of familiar concepts and the addition of new ones. muse also has a repertoire of actions, which range from editing and reporting the contents of its ownmemory to an indirect form of question answering.  examples are presented to demonstrate how the model interpretstext, resolves ambiguities, adds information to memory, generalizes from examples and performs various actions.cacm january, mccalla, g. i.sampson, j. r..knatural language processing, semantic memory, textcomprehension, question answering, artificial intelligence, human memory simulation.c. . . . .ca jb february ,   : am
