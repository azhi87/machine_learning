fast finite-difference solution of biharmonic problems.wsetting the reynolds number equal to zero, ina method for solving the navier-strokes equations numerically, results in a fast numerical method forbiharmonic problems.  the equation is treated as a system of two second order equations and a simplesmoothing process is essential for convergence.  an application is made to a crack-type problem.cacm may, greenspan, d.schultz, d..knumerical analysis, partial differential equations,biharmonic equation, boundary value problem.c.ca jb january ,   : am
