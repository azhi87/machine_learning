on the computer enumeration of finite topologies.wthe problem of enumerating the number of topologieswhich can be formed from a finite point set is considered both theoretically and computationally. certain fundamental results are established, leading to an algorithm for enumerating finite topologies,and computed results are given for n <= .  an interesting side result of the computational workwas the unearthing of a theoretical error which had been induced into the literature; the use of the computerin combinatorics represents, chronologically, an early application, and this side result underscoresits continuing usefulness in this area.cacm may, evans, j. w.harary, f.lynn, m. s.ca jb february ,   : am
