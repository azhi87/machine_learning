organization and structure of dataon disk filememory systems for efficient sorting and other data processing programs.wan approach to the organization and structureof data on bryant disc file memory systems for sorting and performing other data processing functionsis presented.  the following areas are covered: characteristics of bryant disc file systems on the bendixg- and rca ; two proposed "chaining" structures for data; and functions of a disk file executive routine. the concepts for sorting and performing file maintenance processing using the proposed structure andexecutive routine are discussed.  additionally, it is shown that sorting can be accomplishedwithout the use of disk storage work areas.cacm may, goetz, m. a.ca jb march ,   : am
