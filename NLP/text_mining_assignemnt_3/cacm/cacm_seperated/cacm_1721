determination of the intersection points of twoplane curves by means of differential equations.wa new method is proposed to calculate the intersectionpoints of two plane curves.  the theory of singular points off a system of two differential equationsis used in developing the method. the intersection point to be determined is identified with such a singularpoint and appropriate modifications are applied to the system to ensure that the singular point be stable,i.e. all integrals which start in the neighborhood of the singular point will always approach this pointif the integral parameter tends to infinity.  in addition a method is described for systematically searchingfor all intersection points in a prescribed rectangular area.cacm july, kuiken, h. k..kplane curves, intersection points, intersectionsplane curves, integration, differential equations, matrix iteration, singular points, nonlinear differentialequations, eigenvalues, complex roots, roots, stationary points, runge kutta, stable singularity, unstable singularity.c. . . . .ca jb february ,   : am
