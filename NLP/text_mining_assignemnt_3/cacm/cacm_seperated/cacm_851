design and characteristics of a variable-lengthrecord sort using new fixed-length record sorting techniques.wthis paper describes the application of severalnew techniques for sorting fixed-length records to the problems of variable-length record sorting. the techniques have been implemented on a sylvania  computer system with , fixed-length wordsof memory.  specifically, the techniques sequence variable-length records of unrestricted size, producelong initial strings of data, merge strings of data at the power of t-, where t is the number of worktapes in a system, and do not restrict the volume of input data.cacm may,goetz, m. a.ca jb march ,   : am
