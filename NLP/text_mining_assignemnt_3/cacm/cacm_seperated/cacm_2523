a region coloring technique for scene analysis.wa method of converting a picture into a "cartoon"or "map" whose regions correspond to differently textured regions is described.  texture edges in thepicture are detected, and solid regions surrounded by these (usually broken) edges are "colored in" usinga propagation process.  the resulting map is cleaned by comparing the region colors with the textures ofthe corresponding regions in the picture, and also by merging some regions with others according to criteriabased on topology and size.  the method has been applied to the construction of cloud cover mapsfrom cloud cover pictures obtained by satellites.cacm april, strong iii, j. p.rosenfeld, a..kpicture processing, scene analysis, edge detection.c. .ca jb january ,   : am
