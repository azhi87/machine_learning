backtrack programming techniques.wthe purpose of this paper is twofold.  first,a brief exposition of the general backtrack technique and its history is given.  second, it is shown how the useof macros can considerably shorten the computation time in many cases.  in particular, this technique has allowedthe solution of two previously open combinatorial problems, the computation of new terms in a well-knownseries, and the substantial reduction in computation time for the solution to another combinatorial problem.cacm november, bitner, j. r.reingold, e. m..kbacktrack, depth-first search, exhaustive search,macros, combinatorial computing, non-attacking queen's problem, difference-preserving codes, pentominoes,tiling problems, squaring the square.c.ca jb january ,   : am
