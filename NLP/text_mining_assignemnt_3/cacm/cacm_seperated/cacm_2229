construction of rational and negative powers of a formal series.wsome methods are described for the generationof fractional and negative powers of any formal series, such as poisson series or chebyshev series.  itis shown that, with the use of the three elementary operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication,all rational (positive and negative) powers of a series can be constructed.  there are basically twoapproaches: the binomial theorem and the iteration methods.  both methods are described here, and the relationshipbetween them is pointed out.  some well-known classical formulas are obtained as particular cases,and it is shown how the convergence properties of these formulas can be improved with very little additionalcomputations.  finally, at the end of the article, some numerical experiments are describedwith chebyshev series and with fourier series.cacm january, brucke, r. a..kseries expansion, series inversion, root extraction,binomial theorem, newton iterations, chebyshev series, poisson series, fourier series.c. . . .ca jb february ,   : am
