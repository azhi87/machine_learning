positivity and norms.wfollowing some lines of joint work with a.s. householder, the character and use of algebraic methods in the theory of norms is demonstrated.  new resultsconcerning norms with values in an archimedian vector lattice (not necessarily being totally ordered)are given, in particular for the generalization of order unit norms, l-norms and m-norms.  an exampleof application to operator norms is given concerning contraction properties of positive operators.cacm january, bauer, f. l..kmatrices, norms, positivity, numerical range, positivitycones, vector lattice,absolute, monotonic.c. .ca jb january ,   : am
