new lisp techniques for a paging environment.wthe system described herein employs the blockconcept, and that of global and local variables, in addition to the methods applied in most lisp systems. also, a new means of list representation is used: "local sequential" for lists created during compilation,and "block level sequential" for those created dynamically.  a new garbage collection algorithmhas been introduced to make lists as compact as possible; partial garbage collection is performed aftereach block exit instead of total garbage collection when storage is exhausted.  the algorithm does not usethe customary flagging procedure.  this combination of features has eliminated the need for a free list,and effectively minimizes the number of pages used at any moment.cacm december, rochfeld, a..klisp, list processing, paging, virtual memory,garbage collection, core fragmentation, compact list structures, block, segment.c. . .ca jb february ,   : am
