pictorial pattern recognition and thephase problem of x-ray crystallography.wthe availability of interactive, three-dimensional,computer graphics systems coupled to powerful digital computers encourages the development of algorithmsadapted to this environment.  pictorial pattern recognition techniques make possible a number of approachesto x-ray structure determination based on molecular model building, i.e. the use of chemical informationto frame "structural hypotheses" which can computationally be tested and refined by referenceto the experimental data.  application of standard pattern recognition algorithms is hindered by the factthat the cross-correlation between a model and the correct structure cannot be computed because ofa fundamental incompleteness in the measured data.  however, it is possible to compute an upper bound to sucha cross-correlation.  a simple example demonstrates that this information can be the basis of a techniquefor structure determination that can make effective use of an interactive graphics system. model buildingby cross-correlations has intrinsic advantages over usual crystallographic techniques based on theautocorrelation or patterson function, especially for large structures.  this is significant, for crystallographyof biological macromolecules hasbeen and will continue to be a field of intense interest.cacm january, lesk, a. m..kpictorial pattern recognition, phase problem,x-ray crystallography, interactive graphics.c. . .ca jb february ,   : am
