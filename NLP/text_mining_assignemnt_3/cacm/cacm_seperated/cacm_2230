a language for treating geometric patterns in a two-dimensional space.win this paper cadep, a problem-oriented languagefor positioning geometric patterns in a two-dimensional space, is presented.  although the language has beenspecifically designed for the automatic generation of integrated circuit masks, it turns out to be wellsuited also for such other placement problems as architecture design, urban planning, logical and blockdiagram representation.  the design criteria, the structure, and the specific features of cadep are illustrated.cacm january, bracchi, g.ferrari, d..kgraphic language, problem-oriented language, two-dimensionalpatterns, graphic display, fortran extension, layout problems, integrated circuit,architecture design, urban planning.c. . . .ca jb february ,   : am
