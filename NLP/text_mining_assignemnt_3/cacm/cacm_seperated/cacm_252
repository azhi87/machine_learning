programming a duplex computer system.wthis paper describes a method of duplex-computerprogramming that has been used with two computers in a military defense system.  the method combines specialprograms with a basic data processing program package.  the duplex operation gives the system greaterreliability.  after achieving the required level of integration, both computers do similar processingon the same inputs and continually cross-check the intermediate and final results.cacm november, dow, j.ca jb march ,   : pm
