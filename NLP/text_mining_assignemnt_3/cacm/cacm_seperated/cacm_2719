mechanical program analysis.wone means of analyzing program performanceis by deriving closed-form expressions for their execution behavior.  this paper discusses the mechanizationof such analysis, and describes a system, metric, which is able to analyze simple lisp programsand produce, for example, closed-form expressionsfor their running time expressed in terms of size of input. this paper presents the reasons for mechanizing program analysis, describes the operation of metric, explainsits implementation, and discusses its limitations.cacm september, wegbreit, b..kanalysis of programs, performance analysis, executiontime, execution behavior, difference equations, generating functions, list processing, lisp, algebraicmanipulation, programming languages, analysis of algorithms.c. . . .ca jb january ,   : pm
