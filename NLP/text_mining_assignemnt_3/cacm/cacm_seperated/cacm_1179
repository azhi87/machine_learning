pufft-the purdue university fast fortran translator.wa core resident, compile-and-go system designedfor the ibm / computer is described.  in little more than half of the k word core memorypufft provides a monitor for job sequencing, a translator for the full fortran iv language, the fortransubroutine library, an input--output system for use at compile time and at execute time, and a ratherelaborate diagnostic message writing routine.  batches of small- and medium-sized fortran iv sourcelanguage programs are processed at very high speeds.  language compatibility has been maintained so thatprograms may be debugged in the pufft system and then recompiled and run in the ibjob-ibftc system supplied by the manufacturer.cacm november, rosen, s.spurgeon, a.donnelly, j. k.ca jb march ,   : pm
