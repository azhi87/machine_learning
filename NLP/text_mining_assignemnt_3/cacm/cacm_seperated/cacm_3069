a practical interprocedural data flow analysis algorithm.wa new interprocedural  data flow analysis algorithmis presented and analyzed.  the algorithm associates with each procedure in a program informationabout which variables may be modified, which may be used, and which are possibly preserved by a callon the procedure, and all of its subcalls.  the algorithm is sufficiently powerful to be used on recursiveprograms and to deal with the sharing of variables which arises through reference parameters.  the algorithmis unique in that it can compute all of this information in a single pass, not requiring a prepass tocompute calling relationships or sharing patterns.  the algorithm is asymptotically optimal in time complexity. it has been implemented and is practical even on programs which are quite large.cacm september, barth, j.m..kdata flow analysis, global flow analysis, optimization,side effects, relations, reference parameters, incarnations.c. .ca dh february ,   : pm
