fen-an axiomatic basis for program semantics.wa formal system is presented which abstractsthe notions of data item, function, and relation.  it is argued that the system is more suitable than settheory (or its derivatives) for the concise and accurate description of program semantics.  it is shownhow the system can be used to build composite data types out of simper ones with the operations of rowing,structuring, and uniting.  it is also demonstrated that completely new primitive types can be introducedinto languages through the mechanism of singleton data types.  both deterministic and nondeterministicfunctions are shown to be definable in the system.  it is described how the local environment can be modeledas a data item and how imperative statements can be considered functions on the environment.  thenature of recursive functions is briefly discussed, and a technique is presented by which they can be introducedinto the system.  the technique is contrasted with the use of the paradoxical combinator, y.  thequestions of local and global environments and of various modes of function calling and parameter passingare touched upon. the theory is applied to the proof of several elementary theorems concerning the semanticsof the assignment, conditional, and iterative statements.  an appendix is included which presents indetail the formal system governing webs and fen, the abstractions used informally in the body of the paper.cacm august, maclennan, b. j..ksemantics, formal systems, lambda-calculus, extensiblelanguages, data types, modes, axioms, correctness, formal language definition, formal description, data structures,description languages, models of computation.c. . . .ca jb january ,   : am
