the structure of yet another algol compiler.wa high-speed "top down" method of syntax analysiswhich completely eliminates "back-up" of the source string has been implemented in a convenientmacro-language.  a technique of  simulation at compile time of the use of a conventional run-time stackenables the generation of code for expressions which minimizes stores, fetches and stack-pointer motionat run time, while properly trating recursion and side effects of procedures.  block structure andrecursion are handled without need for interpretive methods at run times.  the "context problem" in the transmissionto recursive procedures of parameters "called by name" is solved in a manner which permits thehandling of the common cases of simple expressions and array identifiers with particular efficiency.cacm july, kanner, h.kosinski, p.robinson, c. l.ca jb march ,   : pm
