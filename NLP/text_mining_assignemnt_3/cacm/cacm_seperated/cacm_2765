analysis and performance of inverted data base structures.wthe need to envision and architecture data basesystems in a hierarchical level by level framework is stressed. the inverted data base (file) organizationis then analyzed, considering implementation oriented aspects.  the inverted directory is viewed realisticallyas another large data base which itself is subjected to inversion.  formulations are derivedto estimate average access time (read only) and storage requirements, formalizing the interaction of database content characteristics, logical complexity of queries, and machine timing and blocking specificationsidentified as having a first-order effect on performance.  the formulations presented are necessaryto be used in conjunction with any index selection criteria to determine the optimum set of index keys.cacm may, cardenas, a. f..kdata base architecture, inverted file organization,data base performance and measurement, secondary index organization, information storage and retrieval, query answering.c. . . . . .ca jb january ,   : pm
