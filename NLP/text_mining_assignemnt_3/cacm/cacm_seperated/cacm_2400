use of the hough transformation todetect lines and curves in pictures.whough has proposed an interesting and computationallyefficient procedure for detecting lines in pictures.  this paper points out that the use of angle-radiusrather than slope-intercept parameters simplifies the computation further.  it also showshow the method can be used for more general curve fitting, and gives alternative interpretationsthat explain the source of its efficiency.cacm january, duda, r. o.hart, p. e..kpicture processing, pattern recognition, line detection,curve detection, colinear points, point-line transformation, hough transformation.c.ca jb february ,   : am
