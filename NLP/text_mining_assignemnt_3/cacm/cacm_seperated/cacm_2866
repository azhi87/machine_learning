proving monitors.winteresting scheduling and sequential propertiesof monitors can be proved by using state variables which record the monitor's history and by defining extendedproof rules for their wait and signal operations.  these two techniques are defined, discussed, and appliedto examples to prove properties such as freedom from indefinitely repeated overtaking or unnecessary waitingupper bounds on queue lengths, and historical behavior.cacm may, howard, j.h..kmonitors, correctness, proof rules, historical variables,concurrency, scheduling, bounded buffer, semaphores, alarm clock, disk head.c. . .ca jb january ,   : pm
