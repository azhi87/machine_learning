the development of the mu computer system.wfollowing a brief outline of the backgroundof the mu project, the aims and ideas for mu are discussed.  a description is then given of the instructionset, which includes a number of features conducive to the production of efficient compiled codefrom high-level language source programs.  the design of the processor is then traced from the initialideas for an associatively addressed "name store" to the final multistage pipeline structure involvinga prediction mechanism for instruction prefetching and a function queue for array element accessing.  anoverall view of the complete mu complex is presented together with a brief indication of its performance.cacm january, ibbett, r.n.capon, p.c..karchitecture, naming, virtual storage, instructionset, descriptor, pipeline, instruction buffering, associative storage, function queue, computer complex.c. . . .ca jb march ,   : pm
